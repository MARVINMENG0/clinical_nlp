Chief Complaint: Chest pain radiating to the back with associated nausea

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 79-year-old female, was admitted to [Hospital Name] with a complaint of chest pain radiating to the back with associated nausea. She had a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (in remission). Initial examination showed afebrility with mild epigastric tenderness and blood pressure 161/78 mm Hg. The patient's laboratory values revealed a white blood cell count of 7.33 K/µL and hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct (CBD) without stones but with a slightly dilated gallbladder. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed CBD dilation without definite stricture. However, subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a biliary stricture at the hepatic duct bifurcation. A sphincterotomy was performed, biopsies were obtained, and 2 biliary stents were placed. One stent was placed into the right system, and a second stent went into the left system past the stricture into the right and left hepatic ducts and extending distally into the CBD with adequate bile flow. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

After discharge, the patient immediately began to experience nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. On examination, the patient was found to be markedly tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Computed tomography scan revealed migration of the stent through the duodenal wall. An upper endoscopy was performed, confirming penetration of the stent through the lateral portion of the second part of the duodenum. The stent was then extracted using a grasping device revealing a transmural defect. This was closed using endoclips.

The patient was started on levofloxacin and metronidazole and was monitored in the hospital. She remained clinically stable and was started on a clear liquid diet on post-procedure day 2. She was discharged on post-procedure day 4 and had no complications in follow-up 2 weeks after discharge.

Diagnosis:
Biliary stricture

Procedures:
- Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
- Sphincterotomy
- Placement of two Advanix™ biliary stents
- Removal of migrated biliary stent
- Transmural defect closure using four 11-mm TTS endoclips

Gender: Female
Age: 58

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to a 2-year history of non-productive cough and progressive shortness of breath. She had a history of renal insufficiency and persistent proteinuria, without any extra-renal involvement. She was diagnosed with IgA nephropathy for 15 years and had received immunosuppressive therapy for 6 years.

Physical Examination:
On examination, the patient was afebrile with stable vital signs. Auscultation detected slight coarse crackles at the bilateral bases while the remainder of the examination was unremarkable.

Diagnostic Tests:
Her hemoglobin was 95 g/L but renal function and calcium level were normal. The patient was negative for antinuclear and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Serum free light chain analysis showed measuring lambda light chain of 2.59 g/L. Serum protein electrophoresis revealed low IgG, IgA, and IgM levels, with reported monoclonal lambda light chain peak with the monoclonal protein. A 24-h urine contained 5521 mg of protein. High-resolution chest CT revealed disclosed ground-glass opacities (GGOs) with interlobular septal thickening in bilateral lungs. Chest and abdominal CT shows soft tissue infiltration of the subcutaneous fat layer with asymmetric bulging of the chest and abdominal wall. Pulmonary function tests revealed a moderately restrictive ventilation disorder, with a forced vital capacity (FVC) of 1.76 L and severe reduction of diffusion capacity (DLCO SB). Cardiac biomarkers including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac troponin-T were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular ejection fraction of 61% and there were no features of cardiac amyloidosis. A VATLB showed marked thickening of the alveolar wall deposition of amorphous eosinophilic amyloid at the bronchial mucosa, pulmonary vessel wall, and interstitium. Congo red staining displayed apple-green birefringence in polarized light. The bone marrow examination showed 11.5% plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction.

Diagnosis:
Diffuse parenchymal pulmonary amyloidosis accompanied by multiple myeloma, lambda light chain type, stage I.

Treatment:
The patient was referred to the hematology department, where she started chemotherapy with bortezomib and dexamethasone. Her symptoms relieved 2 months after the initial presentation. No adverse effects were observed, and the laboratory results were stable.

The 12-year-old Saudi boy presented with bleeding per rectum and mild abdominal pain 3 days after a blunt abdominal trauma. Initial examination revealed mild intraperitoneal fluid in his pelvis, later confirmed by CT scan to be mild pelvic hemoperitoneum. Serial observation showed a continuous fall in the hemoglobin level despite two units of packed red blood cells transfusion. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated, with a mild fever, tachycardia, and dropping blood pressure, leading to an urgent laparotomy. An injured Meckel's diverticulum was identified as the source of bleeding, and it was resected. The patient required 2 more units of PRBC transfusion during the operation, and 2 more units postoperatively, which increased the hemoglobin level to 10.2 gm/dl. The patient remained stable after the operation, developed a postoperative superficial surgical site infection, and was discharged home on postoperative day 7 with wound care instructions and OPD follow-up after 1 week. No further complications were found during the OPD visit.

Hospital Course:

A 25-year-old male with a history of blurred vision in the right eye, headache, and weight loss of approximately 30 kg was admitted with a suspected craniopharyngioma. Initial MRI showed a tumor located suprasellarly that was not associated with the pituitary gland. Endocrine evaluation revealed secondary hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency. The tumor was removed, and perioperative frozen section histological examination suggested the tumor to be a possible malignant lymphoma due to lymphocytic infiltration. The patient was transferred to the Department of Endocrinology at Odense University Hospital, where pituitary hormone insufficiency of all anterior axes and diabetes insipidus was diagnosed, and treatment with various hormones was implemented. Final histological diagnosis revealed autoimmune hypophysitis.

Ten months postoperatively, the patient reported impaired vision, and MRI demonstrated that the pituitary remnant tissue was causing pressure on the optic chiasm. Treatment with glucocorticoid pulse therapy was initiated, which was followed by steroid-sparing treatment with azathioprine when the patient had intolerable adverse effects. The patient responded well to treatment, but after an initial reduction in the pituitary mass, there was a recurrence of the mass, and treatment with rituximab was initiated. The patient responded well to rituximab treatment, resulting in almost complete regression of the pituitary mass.

The patient was discharged with the recommendation to follow up with routine imaging and endocrine evaluation. The patient remains in sustained remission with no further complications, with the control MRI showing no evidence of recurrence.

This 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital presenting with increased appetite, palpitations, weight loss, and heat intolerance. Physical examination revealed the presence of a 4 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. The patient had a known history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

Diagnostic Findings:

The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was suppressed 0.29 uIU/mL, while free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were elevated. A radioiodine uptake scan detected an abnormal focus of hot uptake in the left lobe, which was suggestive of a hyperfunctioning toxic thyroid nodule. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed, and the cytology report indicated thyroid carcinoma. 

Treatment:

The patient underwent total thyroidectomy, and the pathological report confirmed FVPTC findings. The lesion was limited to the solitary tumor, measuring a diameter of 3.5 cm. Ablative radioiodine therapy was not recommended due to the small size of the tumor. Post-surgery, the patient received levothyroxine medication to prevent hypothyroidism and to stop TSH stimulation. 

Follow-Up:

Serum TSH and serum thyroglobulin were regularly monitored. On follow-up visit, radioactive iodine whole-body scan showed no distant metastasis. 

Summary:

This 70-year-old male patient presented classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism which were investigated by FNA revealing FVPTC arising within a toxic nodule. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with no distant metastasis on follow-up visit. The patient received post-operative treatment and follow-up monitoring to manage the thyroid status.",1.0,1.0,0

The patient is a 10-year-old girl who presented with a firm, painless swelling in the distal right forearm. X-ray examination revealed a large lobulated, compartmentalized, osteolytic, expansive tumor mass in the metadiaphysis of the distal radius. On MRI, the tumor measured 35 × 46 × 47 mm and had a well-defined boundary, but no sclerotic margin. Imaging features were consistent with a destructive tumor that originated from the distal radius, grew slowly, and then broke through the cortex of the radius into the adjacent soft tissue.

Diagnostic tests revealed a CTNNB1 hotspot class 5 pathogenic variant in exon 3: p.Ser45Phe. Additionally, cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal female karyotype with trisomy 8 detected in 2 cells. On gross examination, the largest tumor fragment measured 6 × 5 × 3 cm. Tumor histology was reminiscent of desmoid fibromatosis and consistent with desmoplastic fibroma.

The patient underwent intralesional excision of the tumor and tolerated the procedure well. Wrist function was unimpaired postoperatively.

The patient was discharged in stable condition and will receive follow-up with an oncologist to monitor for recurrence or metastasis.

Gender: Female
Age: 9 Years old
Admission Date: January 2016
Discharge Date: N/A

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 9-year-old female with no medical history, presented with low back and left lower limb pain in January 2016. She was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left tibia with a solitary metastasis in her L3 vertebrae in February 2016. She subsequently underwent a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation from L1 to L5 with decompression laminectomy at L2-3, and L3-4 through a posterior and left thoracoabdominal approach in March 2016. The patient was found to have an abnormal bone scan with a lesion at the L3 level 3 months after completing chemotherapy in November 2016. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of right paraspinal psoas tissue, the patient was confirmed to have recurrent osteoblastic osteosarcoma in December 2016.

Physical Examination:

On physical examination, the patient was able to ambulate with use of a below knee prosthesis and demonstrated no neurological deficits.

Treatment:

The patient was started on second line drugs, including two cycles of ifosfamide/etoposide. Previous implants were well in place. Imaging was performed with radiographs, CT scan, bone scan, PET scan, and MRI scan with contrast enhancement to confirm only a single metastatic site. The option of nonoperative palliative care was offered to the patient and her family, but they elected to proceed with en bloc resection to maximize her chances of survival, in spite of high surgical risk and an overall poor prognosis. They were informed preoperatively that a complete resection would require sacrificing her nerve roots at L2, L3 and L4. A palliative decompression was not offered for the revision procedure as a treatment option as the patient was not complaining of pain or neurological symptoms, and it would not have improved her life expectancy. 

Conclusion:

In summary, the patient is a 9-year-old female with no previous medical history who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left tibia with a solitary metastasis in her L3 vertebrae. Despite undergoing a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation, the patient was confirmed to have a recurrence of osteoblastic osteosarcoma. The patient was started on second line drugs and subsequently had en bloc resection of L2, L3, and L4. The decision was made with the family to proceed with this risky surgery in order to maximize the patient's chances of survival, despite an overall poor prognosis.",1.0,0.0,0

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a three-day history of increasing abdominal bloating, vomiting, and fevers. On admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.9°C, a heart rate of 127, and a respiratory rate of 35. Initial investigations showed mildly deranged liver enzymes, an elevated CRP, and slightly elevated CA-125 and CA-19.9. CT scan showed a 22 × 13 cm multiseptated cystic lesion almost certainly of ovarian aetiology, as well as omental fat hazing, raising the possibility of an acute omental infarction. The patient was admitted for observation and intravenous antibiotics. Her fever resolved, and she was discharged home with a plan to follow-up in outpatient clinic for elective ovarian cystectomy.

Ten days later, the patient re-presented to the hospital with severe abdominal pain and ongoing fevers. Repeat laboratory results showed worsening liver enzymes and a further rise of CRP. A repeat CT scan showed the large ovarian cyst had likely ruptured with new generalized ascites and peritoneal enhancement, concerning for disseminated disease.

Treatment:
The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and appendectomy. The cyst had a small leak, and 3.5 L of fluid was drained from the cyst and sent for histology. A further 200 ml of ascitic fluid was collected. Inflammatory changes on the surface of the pelvis, and multiple inflammatory deposits overlying small bowel mesentery were noted. Histology of the cyst showed a benign mucinous cystadenoma. The uterus, ovarian cyst, omentum, and appendix contained florid granulomatous inflammation and caseous necrosis. Peritoneal fluid cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest CT confirmed lymph node calcification consistent with previous tuberculosis, with no evidence of active infection.
