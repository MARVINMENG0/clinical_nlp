Reason for Hospitalization:
The patient was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit with complaints of weight loss, cough with hemoptysis, diarrhea, fever, and cervical adenopathies under investigation. She had a past medical history of uterine cancer, herpes-zoster infection, and recent diagnosis of HIV infection.

Hospital Course:
During physical examination, the patient presented with cachexia, tenderness at the palpation of the hypogastric region, and cardiorespiratory arrest. Advanced resuscitation measures were performed, and she was transferred to the emergency room where orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation were initiated. She was subsequently diagnosed with enteric peritonitis, ileal perforation, and large cavity obstruction which required a segmental enterectomy.

Postoperatively, the patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy was initiated. However, despite the treatment, the patient's clinical condition continued to deteriorate, and she eventually passed away on the same day.

Diagnostic Tests:
Diagnostic tests revealed a low CD4+ cell count as well as viral load of HIV by PCR. CT scans showed diffuse parietal thickening, dilatation of the intestinal loops of the jejunum with splenic infarction, and pneumoperitoneum. Blood tests showed raised creatinine, pancreatic amylase, pancreatic lipase, and seric lactates, as well as raised white blood cell count and low hemoglobin.

Final Diagnosis:
The post-mortem histological examination revealed acute transmural inflammation of the enteric wall with suppuration and necrosis with fungal hyphae of the Aspergillus spp. type, and overinfection of Candida albicans, Enterococcus faecium, and Escherichia coli.

Patient Identification:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a medical and dental history of left hemimaxillectomy, adenoidectomy, and partial removal of zygoma due to rhabdomyosarcoma of the left maxillary sinus. He also underwent a FRF of iliac crest, radiotherapy and chemotherapy before and after the surgical intervention. He presented to our outpatient clinic with a complaint of painless swelling in the upper left posterior region.

Hospital Course:
The patient was examined, and an oral examination revealed an exophytic, irregular, pedunculated lesion with elastic consistency in the left maxillary region, associated with the buccal flange and the fitting surface of the upper removable partial denture (RPD). Radiographic investigation did not show any bone resorption at the site of the lesion. A cold-blade incisional biopsy was performed, and dysplasia was ruled out. A decision was made not to wear the RPD for two weeks, and routine blood tests were carried out. A benign lesion with vascular structures and diffuse inflammatory infiltrate of granulocytes and neutrophils, with focal aspects of abscess formation, was revealed upon histological examination after the excision of the lesion by CO2 laser under local anesthesia.

Further Action Taken:
After a three-week follow-up, deepening of the buccal vestibule by CO2 laser was performed to facilitate better stability of the RPD remake, responding to a request from the prosthodontic department.

Summary:
The patient presented with a painless swelling in the left maxillary region associated with the fitting surface of the RPD. The lesion was excised by CO2 laser under local anesthesia, and a biopsy was performed, which ruled out dysplasia.

Clinical Course:
The patient was admitted for ophthalmic assessment due to bilateral blurring of vision. At the time of admission, the patient complained of visual acuity of 1/60 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present in the right eye. Grade 1 vitritis was noted in the same eye, with intense retinitis and focal areas of haemorrhage. There was mild pallor of the left optic disc with macula and peripheral granular retinitis. Based on typical fundus features and history of treated CMV colitis, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral eye CMV retinitis.

The patient was diagnosed with combined T and B cell deficiencies by an immunologist at the age of 11. At that time, she presented with recurrent episodes of high fever, diarrhoea, oral thrush, and failure to thrive. The patient received treatment for CMV colitis, including a six-week course of intravenous ganciclovir, three months prior to presentation of her ophthalmic symptoms. Following assessment, the patient was planned for right eye intravitreal ganciclovir injection to address poor visual function with posterior pole involvement.

However, the patient was deemed unfit to undergo general anaesthesia for the injection due to concomitant hospital acquired pneumonia. Instead, the patient was treated with IV ganciclovir 75mg (6mg/kg) 12 hourly. Good response was noted after two weeks of therapy and treatment was continued for eight weeks until the retinitis lesions had healed with scarring. The patient's right visual acuity reduced to light perception and improved to 6/9 in the left eye.

Admission Date: [Redacted]
Discharge Date: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted due to deterioration of his pre-existing medical conditions, including pulmonary artery aneurysm, severe pulmonic regurgitation, and biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of 22%. The patient had undergone pulmonary artery resection with pulmonary homograft valve 27 mm implantation, resulting in significant improvement of his symptoms and an improved ejection fraction of 45%.

During the hospital stay, the patient developed acute respiratory distress, shortness of breath, and fever. He was found to have contracted Klebsiella pneumonia, which led to multiorgan system failure, including acute liver failure, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. He was also diagnosed with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.

After the patient's multiorgan system failure had subsided, he was discharged from the hospital. He was later found to have reduced left lung volume with restrictive disease of unknown etiology.

Diagnosis:

The patient's medical history was suggestive of an underlying connective tissue disorder, and he had been labeled as having ""either Ehlers-Danlos or Loeys-Dietz syndrome"" due to the family history including cardiomyopathy in three paternal uncles, father, and sister.

Genetic testing identified the likely pathogenic variant c.1039 C>T (p.R347X) in TAB2 in a heterozygous state, which was responsible for the symptoms seen in the patient. The patient's sister was also diagnosed with the same TAB2 variant.

Treatment:

The patient was considered for a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement or some form of mechanical circulatory support including a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), biventricular assist device (BIVAD), or total artificial heart while he waited for a transplant.

Outcome:

The patient's pulmonary valve regurgitation and pulmonary artery aneurysm worsened since his surgery at age 35, with the aneurysm reaching 5.2 cm. These symptoms prompted his placement on the cardiac transplantation list. He has been closely followed up by the cardiology clinic, and treatment options are being considered.

Follow Up:

The patient will continue to follow up with the cardiology clinic as well as other specialists as needed to monitor his condition and consider further treatment options. The patient and his family are advised to continue genetic counseling services.

Diet:

The patient is recommended to follow a healthy and balanced diet and to avoid food and drinks that negatively impact his medical condition.

Activity:

The patient is advised to engage in regular, light physical activity as much as possible, with specific exercises as recommended by his healthcare provider.

Patient: 10-day-old male infant with suspected congenital hypothyroidism and airway obstruction due to ectopic thyroid.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to airway obstruction caused by an ectopic thyroid that was compressing the epiglottis. A hormonal test revealed subclinical hypothyroidism with an increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level that was beyond the normal range. The patient received oral levothyroxine to lower the TSH level and reduce the volume of the ectopic thyroid tissue. However, his symptoms of airway obstruction did not abate, and he eventually underwent surgery after he turned 2 months old.

Procedure:
The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to relieve the airway obstruction caused by the ectopic thyroid. The surgeon made a transverse skin incision measuring 2.5 cm at the level of the hyoid bone and split the hyoid bone at the midline. They then dissected the base of the tongue towards the foramen cecum, detected the ectopic thyroid mass, and suspended the mass by suturing it to the hyoid bone. The degree of suspension of the ectopic thyroid was guided by an intraoperative laryngo fiberscopy to confirm the complete elevation of the epiglottis.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged 4 days postoperatively and required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until postoperative day 22. Follow-up laryngo fiberscopy performed 6 months postoperatively revealed the complete disappearance of compression of the epiglottis by the lingual mass, and CT performed 8 months postoperatively also revealed the relocation of the lingual thyroid gland towards the hyoid bone. At 2 years and 6 months old, the patient's thyroid hormone levels were stable and he was able to maintain his status as euthyroid. The postoperative control of his thyroid hormone status was relatively easy, as his thyroid gland was preserved. The patient did experience a salivary fistula that spontaneously resolved 5 months postoperatively.

Summary:
This discharge summary documents the admission of a 10-day-old male infant who was admitted to the hospital due to airway obstruction caused by an ectopic thyroid. After undergoing surgery to relieve the obstruction, the patient was discharged and made a full recovery. Ongoing follow-up has shown stable thyroid hormone levels and no major complications.",,,1

Final Diagnosis: Adult Onset Still's Disease (AOSD)

Hospital Course:
The 32-year-old patient presented with high fever, abdominal pain, and anorexia when she was 16 years of age. The patient experienced similar symptoms over the next 4 years leading to multiple hospital admissions with elevated C-reactive protein levels, and traces of protein in urine. Diagnostic tests including blood and urine cultures, and abdominal ultrasound revealed no obvious pathology. Upon sudden onset of polyarthritis, fever, and widespread skin rash at age 21, the patient's acute phase reaction was highly elevated with hyperferritinemia. The diagnosis of AOSD was established based on typical clinical features and exclusion of other autoimmune rheumatological diseases. The patient responded well initially to oral corticosteroids, though attempts to introduce DMARDS including hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and methotrexate were largely ineffective. Following treatment with tocilizumab, the patient ceased long-term corticosteroid use and has remained well-controlled on tocilizumab monotherapy for the past 2 years.

Family History:
Inquiries into the patient's family history revealed two children with unexplained inflammatory symptoms. The patient's daughter experienced recurrent episodes of malaise, high fever, erythematous skin rash, and mouth ulcers from 8 months of age and later developed episodic abdominal pain and knee pain that disappeared between the episodes. Since being prescribed colchicine, the daughter has not had further inflammatory episodes or symptoms. The patient's son also experienced monthly high fever episodes since age 5, which were occasionally accompanied by vomiting, mouth ulcers, and a salmon-pink rash. Colchicine treatment has been less effective for the son. The father of the patient has early onset RA, but limited information on symptoms and diagnostic tests is available.

Treatment and Follow-Up:
Following the patient's response to tocilizumab treatment, she was discharged with instructions to continue monthly IV infusion at current dosing and attend follow-up appointments with the rheumatologist. No further investigations or treatments were recommended at this time.

Complications and Comorbidities:
None reported.

Recommendations for Primary Care:
The patient should continue to receive tocilizumab treatment at monthly dosing. Any significant changes in symptoms or side-effects should be reported immediately to the rheumatologist. The patient's children should undergo further evaluations of their inflammatory symptoms.

The patient, a 75-year-old male with a history of end-stage renal disease and Enterococcus faecalis bacteremia, was admitted to our hospital for subacute functional decline and encephalopathy. On admission, he had a leukocytosis and bilateral pleural effusions. Imaging and testing revealed left ventricular and right ventricular systolic dysfunction, mild pulmonary hypertension, and no visible valvular vegetations. Thoracentesis of the patient's pleural effusions identified Enterococcus faecalis growth, leading to the performance of a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).

During the TEE procedure performed on hospital day nine, the patient received 70 mg of propofol administered over the first ten minutes of the procedure. The patient's blood pressure dropped precipitously, and he experienced a PEA cardiac arrest. After four rounds of chest compressions and epinephrine administration, the patient achieved ROSC. However, the patient's cardiac rhythm deteriorated into ventricular fibrillation, which required defibrillation and further chest compressions. ROSC was achieved again, and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit.

Upon review of the TEE images, it was noted that the patient's RV was severely dilated with minimal contractile function, and a small pericardial effusion was found. Due to the critical nature of the patient's condition, comfort measures were implemented, and the patient's family opted for transition to end-of-life care.

Patient Information
Name: [redacted]
Gender: Female
Age: 23 years

Hospital Course Summary
The patient was admitted with a 4-month history of fluctuating weakness of the right upper and lower extremities associated with a band-like sensation of the trunk along with bowel and bladder disturbances. There was also a month-long history of neck movement-related electric-like sensation on the nape. Weakness progressed to the left lower extremity causing difficulty in ambulation and eventually became quadriparetic. The patient's condition deteriorated and she developed dysphagia, dysphonia, difficulty breathing, and projectile vomiting.

Initial Assessment
The patient was hemodynamically stable upon admission with no spinal deformities noted. She had lax sphincter tone and hypesthesia was described. The patient was hyper-reflexic on both the upper and lower extremities along with bilateral extensor toe sign.

Diagnostic Tests
Initial work-up included a cranio-spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing a long expansile contrast-enhancing mass involving the entire spinal cord, from the level of the cervical region to the conus medullaris with extension to the lower medulla oblongata. 

Medical Management
The patient was started on dexamethasone, which provided minimal relief of symptoms. She was referred to the neurosurgery service and was advised for surgery.

Outcome
Unfortunately, on the 20th hospital day, the patient's symptoms progressed to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. She subsequently developed healthcare-associated pneumonia succumbing to septicemia.

Autopsy
On autopsy, all lobes of the lungs were consolidated secondary to pneumonia. There was swelling of the entire spinal cord with white to yellow mucoid material coming out from the central canal. Cut sections showed that the entire spinal cord and caudal medullary region were replaced by mucoid material. Histopathologic examination of the spinal cord revealed a cellular tumor arranged around the central canal of the cord. The cells are generally small, with round to slightly ovoid nuclei. Fibrillary processes were noted in the cytoplasm.

Diagnosis
The patient was diagnosed with holocord oligodendroglioma.

Recommendation
Further genetic characterization of the tumor such as IDH, 1p/19q codeletion, MGMT, EGFR and TP53 mutations were not done because of its unavailability in the institution but its histologic and immunochemical features are consistent with holocord oligodendroglioma.",,,1

Admission date: [date]   Discharge date: [date]

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was admitted after a sudden decrease in heart rate, decreased oxygen saturation, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures after undergoing outpatient control gastroscopy. CT scans revealed that the patient had massive air embolism in the right hemisphere and around the whole length of the esophagus. The patient was immediately transferred to the hyperbaric unit and commenced on HBOT treatment with United States Navy for 8 hours and 5 minutes. A second CT scan 12 hours later showed a marked improvement with only slight reduced attenuation in the right parietal area. A diffusion-weighted MRI performed 14 hours after air embolism revealed cytotoxic edema in the areas previously showing the greatest amount of air embolism on the initial CT scan.

The patient continued to receive HBOT treatment 2.8 ATA, 113 minutes for 4 days and was monitored for intracranial pressure (ICP) instability with intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring, microdialysis, and continuous electroencephalography (EEG). The patient was administered pentothal at burst suppression until day 10 due to ICP instability and suspicion of status epilepticus. Levetiracetam was prescribed to the patient due to epileptic activity detected on EEG. After two weeks, there were no signs of seizures, and the patient's levetiracetam treatment was discontinued.

Over the next few weeks, the patient underwent various radiology tests, including four brain CT scans, one CT angiography of the brain and neck arteries, five CT of the thorax/esophagus/pulmonary arteries, and three MRI scans of the brain, which revealed progressive improvement.

The patient's condition slowly improved, and by day 13, the patient was responsive and obeyed commands but with left hemiplegia. The patient was extubated on day 15, and the patient continued to recover until discharge from neurorehabilitation 3 months after the insult.

Admitted for suspected LC, CT scan confirmed primary tumor in the right middle lobe and metastases in lymph nodes, brain, adrenal glands, and bones. Histological examination of a needle biopsy of the left cervical lymph node confirmed adenocarcinoma. Patient diagnosed with stage IVB LC and underwent chemotherapy with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab. During the chemotherapy session, patient complained of severe right lower quadrant pain and was diagnosed with appendicitis by enhanced CT scan showing an enlarged appendix and fluid collection near the distal appendix. Laparoscopic appendectomy was performed, and histological analysis revealed invasive adenocarcinoma in the appendix that infiltrated the mucosal, submucosal, and muscular layers. Positive immunostaining of TTF-1 indicated that the appendiceal metastasis was from pulmonary adenocarcinoma. Patient discharged after an uneventful postoperative course. Chemotherapy was resumed after surgery under the supervision of the pulmonary internist. No additional metastases or peritoneal dissemination were found during laparoscopic survey of the abdominal cavity.",,,1
865,"Hospital Course:

The 59-year-old male patient had presented with nausea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. He had previously been diagnosed with a stage T1A nonsmall cell lung cancer in the right upper lobe. The patient had refused surgery and completed Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Serial surveillance imaging showed no abnormalities until the current presentation. 

Diagnostic Assessment:

A total body PET-CT scan was ordered due to the patient's prior history of cancer. The results showed thickening of the wall of the gastric fundus and a mass in the tail of the pancreas. Additionally, a 1.1-cm filling defect within the splenic vein was observed. Upper endoscopy revealed a 5-cm infiltrative and ulcerated mass in the gastric fundus. Gastric biopsies showed poorly differentiated carcinoma. EUS confirmed a hypoechoic round mass in the pancreas with local vascular involvement and splenic vein thrombus and was diagnosed with neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Treatment:

Treatment options, including palliative care, were discussed with the patient and his family, and the patient elected to receive symptomatic treatment.

Conclusion:

Metastasis of the primary lung tumor to the stomach is infrequent and sporadic. Symptomatic cases present with epigastric pain, chronic anemia, signs of GI bleed (hematemesis, melena), and gastric perforations. The patient's case illustrates the potential for cancer to spread via hematogenous and lymphatic routes. EUS-FNA in combination with immunohistochemistry is useful in diagnosing metastatic lesions and differentiating those from synchronous primary lesions.",,,1

The patient was admitted to the surgery clinic with a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia and an enlarging right inguinal hernia with associated discomfort. Physical examination revealed a cystic mass located on the superior right testicle and a firm, solid mass in the right groin. Follow-up CT scan revealed a partially visualized, heterogenous, and enhancing right inguinal mass, raising concern for a peripheral nerve sheath tumor or sarcoma of the spermatic cord. The mass was surgically excised from the spermatic cord and was submitted for pathology evaluation.

Pathology results revealed a heterogeneous pattern-less architecture with alternating hypocellular and hypercellular areas, interstitial hyalinization, and intermixed with ropy collagen bands. The most prominent feature of the tumor was found within the vascular compartment. Numerous small- to medium-sized vessels were present and revealed a continuum of changes, ranging from thick-walled vessels showing proliferation of myocytes, to vessels revealing intimal thickening, and to vessels with circumferential prominent mural hyalinization. Some of the larger vessels displayed subendothelial mucoid degeneration resembling vascular changes observed during accelerated hypertension. Occasional individual exuberant hemangiopericytoma-like vascular channels were also present.

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the tumoral cells expressed CD34, BCL-2, and CD99. They were also focally positive for Estrogen Receptor (ER) and Progesterone Receptor (PR) and negative for Smooth Muscle Actin (SMA) and S100.

Chief Complaint:
Patient was admitted with right intermittent claudication of 3 years.

History of Present Illness:
Patient, a 76-year-old Asian man, had a 55-year history of dm2 and had been treated with insulin for 3 years. Upon vascular examination, the patient had a right femoral bruit and diminished right popliteal pulse, suggesting the presence of a right femoral lesion. However, the right ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured by a volume plethysmograph was 1.28, within the normal range, while the left ABI was elevated to 1.55, indicating that the infrapopliteal arteries at the left ankle were incompressible. Upstroke time of the right ankle was prolonged, whereas upstroke time of the left ankle was within the normal range. These findings suggest that the right ABI was falsely normalized due to incompressible infrapopliteal arteries at the right ankle despite the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the right extremity.

Past Medical History:
The patient had diabetic retinopathy and a 55-year history of dm2.

Hospital Course:
The patient was treated with supervised exercise training and did not undergo revascularization. After completion of the 6-month supervised exercise training program, he continued to spend 2 hours a day walking. Five years from the initial assessment, the right ABI had decreased to 0.83, with upstroke time at the right ankle indicating the progression of the right lower extremity PAD. However, there was no deterioration in his symptoms, and he had no difficulty in performing daily activities.

Diagnostic Tests:
Intra-arterial angiography revealed the presence of a severe stenotic lesion at the origin of the right superficial femoral artery, whereas there was no occlusive arterial disease in the left extremity. Fluoroscopic images showed severe calcification of infrapopliteal arteries at the right ankle. Computed tomography also revealed severe calcification of the bilateral infrapopliteal arteries.

Admitting Diagnosis: Suspected urinary tract infection with perineal pain and fever

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient, a 56-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and meatal stenosis with incomplete bladder emptying, was admitted into the hospital with symptoms of perineal pain and fever. The patient had been seen in the emergency room a week prior to the admission with the same complaints and was placed on a 14-day course of antibiotics. 

Upon admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, but physical examination showed mild tenderness at penoscrotal junction with induration, elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and hemoglobin A1c levels. Emphysematous changes were noted on CT scan, and the patient had a postvoid residual of 320 ml. Thus, a transurethral Foley catheter was placed with withdrawal of 700 ml of clear yellow urine; culture reports are still pending.

The patient was initiated on intravenous meropenem, fluconazole, and daptomycin. A subsequent CT scan showed no significant changes, and the patient remained febrile. Based on the recommendation of the Infectious Disease team, the patient was switched to piperacillin/tazobactam which resulted in a slight decrease in fever. A pelvic MRI with and without gadolinium was obtained, and reduced blood flow to corpus spongiosum compared to corpus cavernosum with gadolinium was discovered.

Due to worsening symptoms, the patient underwent debridement of remaining necrotic spongiosal tissue and placement of a penrose drain. The intraoperative wound culture later tested positive for Candida glabrata, which was identical to the patient's urine culture. According to the recommendation of the Infectious Disease team, the patient was prescribed micafungin for the infection, and he was discharged on a 14-day course of oral voriconazole with the transurethral Foley in place.

Final diagnosis: Candida glabrata infection with necrotizing spongiositis of the penis.

Follow-up:
The patient was instructed to follow-up with his urologist for evaluation of the persistent induration in the penoscrotal junction and the transurethral Foley. He was also advised to monitor his blood sugar levels closely, ensure proper nutrition and exercise, follow up with his primary care physician, and continue taking his prescribed medications. 

Overall, the patient's condition had improved, and he was advised to seek medical attention immediately if he experiences any concerning symptoms or see his urologist if any new symptoms arise.",,,1

Admitting Diagnosis: Complete bifid penis

Medical History: The patient was brought to the Center for Anatomical Science and Education for anatomical dissection purposes, under the Saint Louis University Gift Body Program.

Hospital Course: During routine dissection, it was observed that the patient had a bifid penis that was 9.2 cm long and divided longitudinally into right and left parts, each with its own glans and prepuce. There was no urethra in the phallus, and the urethral meatus was located at the base of the divided phallus, indicating proximal penoscrotal hypospadias.

A histological examination showed that the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder extended to 3.9 cm on the ventral surface of each phallus and resembled stratified squamous epithelium. The scrotum was large, containing left and right testes with a normally routed spermatic cord. There was no epididymis, but the vas deferens continued directly from each testis to the seminal vesicle of the same side.

Pathologic-examination showed a small mass of hard tissue on the left side, measuring 0.5 cm by 0.5 cm, located at the site of the prostate gland. Histologically, it did not resemble prostatic glandular tissue and did not have any connection with the vas deferens or seminal vesicle.

Discharge Diagnosis: Complete bifid penis with proximal penoscrotal hypospadias accompanied by absent epididymis.

Reason for Admission:

The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with worsening right shoulder pain, radiating down the right arm, and accompanied by intermittent fevers for the last two days.

Hospital Course:

The patient had mild leukocytosis with predominant neutrophilia and an elevated C-reactive protein level. The initial shoulder aspirate analysis was negative for any organisms, but showed some scanty pus cells. The patient was started on intravenous flucloxacillin due to her continuing temperature spikes, and an MRI was ordered, which confirmed subscapularis abscess formation as the cause of the patient's presenting symptoms. The patient underwent surgical open drainage of the right subscapularis abscess under general anaesthesia that yielded PVL- positive S. aureus sensitive to flucloxacillin.

The patient was given a two-week course of flucloxacillin and was followed up after six weeks, during which the wound had healed well, and the shoulder pain had resolved with no signs of infection recurrence. The patient still exhibited limited range of movement of the shoulder for which she was referred to physiotherapy.

The 19-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital in December 2017 with a recent diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. The patient presented with pharyngeal pain and a left neck mass with fever for 2 months. The patient received a tracheotomy because of airway obstruction resulting from a large mass arising from the left parapharyngeal space at a local clinic. PET/CT scan shows a large solid mass located in the left parapharyngeal space with compression of the pharyngeal cavity and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck. The histopathological review confirmed diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. 

Treatment and Management:

Chemotherapy was initially started with the aim of stabilization of the fulminate disease course; however, the lesions did not shrink and pain and dysphagia were heavier caused by the compression of the pharynx. In order to relieve the compression, irradiation to the lesions of pharyngeal and neck was started. After irradiation, the size of lesions became a little bit smaller.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue was performed and showed the presence of oncogenic mutations. The patient began to take a specific medication. After one month of treatment, a partial response was observed. The medication was continued for two months, however, the patient could no longer afford such an expensive drug. 

NGS was done again and the patient was treated with a medication that was more affordable. Two months after the treatment, excellent PR was observed compared with tumor size in March 2018. Four months later the re-evaluation showed a nearly complete remission.

Patient: 33-year-old male with a history of Crohn’s disease

Hospital course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital due to the progression of stoma stenosis caused by abdominal wall abscess formation around his ascending colonic stoma. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in the patient's fecal culture examination. Consistent with the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, the patient underwent colectomy and colostomy surgeries and was treated conservatively for progressive inflammation before surgery. Afterward, the patient underwent colostomy closure, ileocecal resection, abdominal wall abscess and fistula debridement, and ileostomy construction through a midline incision. The patient was classified as ASA physical class 2 and wound was stratified as class IV. The long operation time and dirty, infected condition created a high risk for surgical site infection (SSI). However, the surgical site was successfully closed with no signs of infection on POD 14.

Treatment:
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was applied after surgery using the V.A.C. system (KCI USA, Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA). The dressing was changed every 2 days, and the skin defect wound was closed using sutures from both edges in a stepwise manner. For the postoperative period, the patient was administered prophylactic antibiotics, 1 g of cefmetazole intravenously once every 12 h for 7 days. The wound was continuously monitored, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on POD16.

Outcome:
The patient's condition improved daily, and the wound site was closed without any signs of infection on POD 14. The pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed colonic stenosis and chronic inflammation, but no malignant changes were observed. The patient's laboratory findings were within the normal ranges, except for anemia and malnutrition, respectively. In conclusion, the patient demonstrated a successful response to NPWT application in the treatment of the wound site, and the healing process was well-managed by the clinical staff.",,,1

Hospital Course:

A 59-year-old woman with a history of locally advanced bladder cancer and primary lung adenocarcinoma presented with extensive bleeding from her ileostomy site. She had undergone pelvic exenteration and ileal conduit formation in November 2015. CT imaging performed in January 2016 raised the possibility of cirrhosis; however, this was not biopsy-proven. In April 2016, she began to notice intermittent bleeding from her stoma. In December 2016, her first episode of confusion was noted and CT imaging demonstrated strong radiographic suspicion for cirrhosis together with prominent vessels surrounding the urinary diversion site suspicious for portal hypertension. She was diagnosed clinically with cryptogenic cirrhosis in May 2017 during a hospitalization for fatigue, anasarca, and altered mental status. An upper endoscopy performed in June 2017 demonstrated portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices. 

When the patient presented to the Emergency Department in July 2017 with significant hemorrhage from her stoma, she was emergently taken to the interventional suite for embolization via peristomal varix access. The catheter position was confirmed with repeat venography, and multiple coils were deployed followed by Gelfoam embolization. Postembolization venography showed sluggish flow in the draining varix with multiple filling defects within the visualized collaterals consistent with embolization. Given the successful outcome of the procedure, the patient became hemodynamically stable shortly thereafter. At 6-month follow-up time no further imaging had been performed, and the patient had not had any further episodes of hemorrhage from the ileostomy site.

Diagnosis:

1. Cryptogenic cirrhosis with portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Summary:

The patient presented with extensive bleeding from her ileostomy site and subsequently underwent successful embolization via peristomal varix access.

Summary:
Mr. [redacted], a 37-year-old male with no prior medical history, presented to secondary-care hospital with wide complex tachycardia of two hours duration. Chest discomfort and thumping sensation were noted, and he was treated for VT in the emergency room. A single 1mg/kg dose of lidocaine terminated the tachycardia. He was referred to our center for further evaluation, where he underwent testing including normal ECG and normal serial cardiac enzymes. His coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries.

An electrophysiologic study (EPS) was conducted to rule out an accessory pathway (AP). During the study, tachycardia was induced with atrial and ventricular extrastimulation, and it was determined that the earliest local ventricular activation occurred at the distal coronary sinus (CS). This suggested either VT with 1:1 retrograde atrial activation or an aAVRT involving a left free-wall AP. The tachycardia was entrained from the high right atrium (HRA), giving an atrium-ventricle-atrium (AVA) response, to differentiate the aAVRT from VT. A transseptal puncture was carried out to attain left ventricle (LV) electrogram, and RF was delivered at the spot. Tachycardia terminated in the AP within 7 s of RF application, which was continued for 62 s. Thereafter, no tachycardia was inducible. A post-ablation atrioventricular node (AVN) Wenckebach block occurred, with no induction of tachycardia or preexcitation.

Medical History: Positive for MDS and cholecystectomy. Daily medications included thalidomide, deferasirox, dimethicone, pantoprazole, gabapentin, vitamin B12, and folic acid. The patient also took erythropoietin and rivaroxaban three times a week and filgrastim every fifth day.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with complaints of abdominal pain, fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. On admission, he was ill and dehydrated with tenderness of the epigastrium and right upper quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory results showed abnormalities, and abdominopelvic ultrasonography revealed mild fluid in subhepatic and inflamed echogenic fat in the upper abdomen and around the pancreas. A CT scan demonstrated edematous wall thickening of the entire duodenum with water halo and significant adjacent fat stranding and swelling of the pancreas, implying the possibility of ischemia or necrosis.

The patient was managed with intravenous antibiotics and fluid resuscitation. However, his condition deteriorated, leading to severe electrolyte imbalance, gasping, severe acidosis (arterial pH = 6.8), and GCS 4/15. The second CT scan revealed a marked decrease in the enhancement of the edematous duodenum and target sign, suggesting microvascular ischemia or necrosis.

The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room, where a midline laparotomy incision was made. Kocher’s maneuver was performed to explore the duodenum and the retroperitoneal structures. A Whipple’s procedure was planned initially, but the patient's cardiac arrest during the operation directed the plan to a damage control surgery. The overall operation time was approximately one hour and a half. To achieve a damage control surgery, decompression of the stomach was done by a red (18 French) nasogastric tube. Lastly, an open (corrugated sheet) drain was placed near the duodenum.

Despite two hours of supportive therapy, blood pressure remained 40 mmHg/pulse, leading to a cardiac arrest with asystole rhythm and patient expiration.

Impressions:

From the available data, the patient had a severe case of duodenal ischemia or necrosis after admission with abdominal pain, fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. The possible etiologies may have been microvascular ischemia or necrosis.

The patient, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the psychiatric emergency room with dysmorphic mood. Subsequently, he was referred to medical service to manage hyponatremia. The patient had a past medical history of lumbar spondylosis managed with intermittent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. He occasionally consumed alcohol but denied having any history of diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, binge drinking, abdominal trauma, any offending drugs, and any procedures including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The family history was unremarkable.
During admission, the patient experienced abdominal discomfort that worsened alongside a fever. The patient developed tachycardia and hypotension, and the physical examination was notable for mild tenderness in the epigastrium. Laboratory investigations showed increased levels of hematocrit, leukocytes with neutrophil predominance, platelets, creatinine, C-reactive protein, amylase, and lipase. An alarming laboratory finding was a severe elevation of TGs with mild AP. The diagnosis of HTG-induced AP was established.
The patient received aggressive intravenous rehydration therapy, antiemetics, opioids for pain control, and insulin to decrease TG levels. The patient's condition improved significantly, and apheresis was not performed due to the response to insulin therapy alone. The patient was discharged after his condition had improved, and he began tolerating oral feeds. Fenofibrate was initiated, and empiric antibiotic therapy was stopped due to negative blood cultures.

The 80-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to pulmonary adenocarcinoma with metastases and comorbidities including COPD, heart disease, and diabetes. Stereotaxic radiotherapy was administered, and the patient underwent several cycles of chemotherapy with vinorelbine while receiving corticosteroids for COPD-related dyspnoea. Following a CT scan of the chest, the patient was found to have a large amount of gas in adipose tissue along the caecum, ascending and transverse colon with no signs of bowel wall distress or perforation. The surgical consultant recommended close observation. One week later, an abdominal plain film documented the persistence of PI along the right and transverse colon but the patient reported no abdominal pain or fever. The oncologist decided to reduce steroid doses and gradually proceed with vinorelbine. Follow-up CT scans showed minimum extent PI limited to the caecum.

Patient 1, a 74-year-old male, underwent HoLEP for bladder outlet obstruction and bladder stones. During the procedure, there was an area of capsular perforation at the 5 o'clock position in the mid gland, and significant abdominal distention was noted upon removal of the operative drapes. General surgery was consulted, and a subumbilical minilaparotomy was performed to address the abdominal distention, revealing retroperitoneal extravasation without intraperitoneal bladder injury or perforation. A 10F Jackson-Pratt drain was placed in the pelvis, and the patient was transferred to the ICU for hemodynamic monitoring and observation.

On POD 1, the patient was progressing well and transferred to the floor in stable condition. The Jackson-Pratt drain output decreased significantly from 710 cc on POD 0 to 81 cc on POD 1 and was subsequently removed on POD 2 after draining 20 cc. Cardiology was consulted in the ICU because of prolonged PR interval and bradycardia, which ultimately warranted no further work-up.

The patient, a 68-year-old female presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The notably past medical history includes hypertension, high cholesterol, chronic kidney disease stage 3, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Initial vital signs and laboratory investigations confirms acute systolic heart failure with markedly elevated BNP levels. Following prompt medical management, the patient demonstrated symptomatic improvement and was started on guideline-directed medical therapy including beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, aldosterone antagonist and an oral diuretic. Subsequent left and right heart catheterization reveals widely patent coronary vessels, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The patient continued to attend regular bevacizumab infusions with her haematologist as this was not thought to be the cause of her cardiomyopathy at the time. Unfortunately, the patient developed recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema deemed to be due to medication non-compliance and subsequently experienced sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath at home followed by ventricular fibrillation related cardiac arrest which required prolonged resuscitation attempts leading to therapeutic hypothermia, but eventually passed away 3 days later.

Hospital: [Redacted]
Service: Otolaryngology

Chief Complaint:
Progressive asymmetric hearing loss and limited communication ability.

Hospital Course:

The patient was referred for hearing rehabilitation with cochlear implant on the left side due to progressive asymmetric hearing loss and limited communication ability. Word recognition score on the left side was 20% with hearing aid and 50% on the right side with FM system testing at 65 dB SPL.

A contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) revealed an intra- and extracanalicular vestibular schwannoma (VS) or acoustic neuroma. Possible treatment options included tumor removal via a retrosigmoid approach or stereotactic radiotherapy as first-line therapy. The patient underwent tumor removal via a retrosigmoid approach. Vestibulocochlear and facial nerves were preserved as their functionality was monitored with electrophysiologic monitoring (neuromonitoring). There was a small residual intracanalicular VS six months postoperatively. Subsequently, the patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy before cochlear implantation with 13 Gy (70% Isodose; Dmax 18.6 Gy) delivered in a single session.

Six weeks later, the cochlear implant was placed more posterior than usual to minimize artifacts in postoperative MRI scans. Six months after cochlear implantation, the first postoperative MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR with medium bandwidth. One month after implantation, aided word recognition score (WRS) with cochlear implant on the left side (and masking of the right side) was 45% with FM testing at 65 dB SPL and six months later, 60%. Binaural hearing with cochlear implant on the left side and hearing aid on the right side resulted in an aided WRS of 90% with FM testing after two years.

Hearing in noise was measured with the aided Oldenburg Sentence test (OLSA). One year postoperatively, the test revealed scores of −1.1 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the left side with cochlear implant (with masking of the right ear) and −3 dB with cochlear implant and hearing aid on the right side, indicating an improvement of hearing in noise with cochlear implant.

Impression:

The patient underwent vestibular schwannoma resection via a retrosigmoid approach with preserved vestibulocochlear and facial nerves. He subsequently underwent a stereotactic radiotherapy before cochlear implantation with good hearing outcomes. The patient demonstrated significant improvement in word recognition score, binaural hearing, and hearing in noise after cochlear implantation. 

Plan:

Continue follow-up with audiology to monitor hearing outcomes. Consider MRI surveillance to evaluate recurrent/suspicious growth of vestibular schwannoma. Provide annual hearing and vestibular function assessments.",,,1

Chief Complaint: Bilateral intermittent claudication and exertional dyspnea

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with complaints of bilateral intermittent claudication and exertional dyspnea. The patient  was being treated with insulin. The patient had diabetic retinopathy and had a history of smoking, with a 40 pack-year history. On vascular examination, there was a right femoral bruit, diminished right popliteal pulse, and absent right and left dorsalis pedis pulses. These findings suggested the presence of right femoral and bilateral infrapopliteal lesions.

The patient's right ABI and left ABI were within normal range; however, the upstroke times in the right and left ankles were prolonged (≥ 180 milliseconds), indicating the presence of bilateral lower-extremity PAD. Furthermore, the right ABI decreased from 1.11 to 0.48, and the left ABI decreased from 1.03 to 0.67 after exercise. Computed tomography angiography revealed the presence of right SFA stenotic lesions, bilateral infrapopliteal occlusive lesions, and spotty calcification in bilateral infrapopliteal arteries. Intra-arterial angiography showed the presence of right SFA stenotic lesions and bilateral infrapopliteal occlusive lesions. Coronary angiography showed severe stenotic lesions in the right coronary artery and the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD), and the patient underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for the LAD stenosis. 

After percutaneous coronary intervention, the patient underwent supervised exercise training. The patient was discharged in stable condition with appropriate medication and follow-up was advised.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a 6-week history of haematuria and was diagnosed with a locally advanced clear cell RCC. He underwent left partial nephrectomy, which was followed by the development of ESRD and initiation of dialysis 3 times/week. The patient later underwent left radical nephrectomy due to local recurrence and subsequent bone and lung metastases. High-dose palliative radiotherapy was given to the renal bed followed by systemic treatment with dose-reduced pazopanib. However, follow-up CT scan 3 months later showed significant disease progression. Consequently, nivolumab 3 mg/kg was initiated, and the dose was later changed to 240 mg flat dose intravenously every 2 weeks. The patient tolerated the treatment well, with no grade 2-4 toxicities observed. 

Clinical Findings:

The patient's pain score improved significantly after nivolumab treatment, reducing from 8/10 to 3/10. His ECOG performance status also improved from 3 to 2. Follow-up imaging indicated a partial response according to RECIST version 1.1, with a considerable reduction in the size of metastases in the lung and renal bed. The patient has now been on nivolumab for 22 months with serial imaging showing an ongoing response.

253,"Hospital Course:
The patient is a 34-year-old pregnant female with a gdm and three previous miscarriages due to hypertensive peaks. She was admitted to the endocrinology department at 20 weeks of amenorrhea due to a hypertensive crisis, headaches, palpitations, and hot flashes. Diagnosis of a secretory neuroendocrine tumor was suspected, and a biological assessment including urinary and plasma catecholamines came back positive. An abdominal-pelvic MRI showed an abdominal latero-aortic mass measuring 36 * 33 mm, corresponding to paraganglioma.

The patient was scheduled for surgery for laparoscopic removal of her paraganglioma. The anesthetic management was carefully planned to prevent perioperative morbidity related to hemodynamic instability. After installation in left lateral decubitus proclive 30°, the patient underwent anesthesia induction, intubation, and maintenance of anesthesia with close monitoring of vital signs. During tumor manipulation, episodes of arterial hypertension and hypotension were observed and managed with analgesia, administration of vasoactive drugs and close glycemic monitoring.

The tumor removal was followed by episodes of arterial hypotension, which were managed by lightening anesthesia and volemic expansion with drug administration. For paraganglioma extraction, the procedure lasted 2 hours, with an intraoperative diuresis of 500 ml and estimated bleeding of 80 cc. After the procedure, the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for clinical and biological monitoring and was weaned from all drugs two days later.

Obstetrical evaluation with a foeto-placental ultrasound was performed, which returned normal with the presence of fetal heart activity. The patient will continue to be monitored.",,,1
133,"Hospital Course:

The patient is a 79-year-old female with a history of hypertension, heart failure, and middle cerebral artery infarction who underwent total hip arthroplasty under general anesthesia. Before the surgery, several modalities were monitored, including electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index monitoring. The anesthesia was induced with propofol and rocuronium, and intra-arterial cannulation was performed for continuous blood pressure monitoring. During surgery, the patient experienced a drop in oxygen saturation levels from 93.1% to 83.1%. The patient was ventilated at a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4, and the arterial blood gas showed that the partial pressure of oxygen dropped from 161.6 to 51.2, which suggested atelectasis due to a collapsed lung. Treatment included increasing the positive end expiratory pressure to 10 cm H2O and FiO2 to 1.0 and performing a recruitment maneuver. The patient's oxygen saturation level increased only temporarily and dropped again to 81%. To address this, muscle relaxation was reversed, and spontaneous respiration was induced. The oxygen saturation level recovered to 90%, and the surgery continued. 

Discharge Summary:

The patient, having undergone surgery, was monitored for her vital signs and underwent various modalities (electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index monitoring) prior to the procedure. Unfortunately, the patient suffered a drop in oxygen saturation levels during surgery, which was due to atelectasis (a collapsed lung). The medical team administered adjustments to the patient's ventilation parameters and was able to recover the oxygen saturation level temporarily. However, to fully address the issue, muscle relaxants were reversed, and spontaneous respiration was induced. This led to a recovery of the oxygen saturation level. After the surgery, the patient recovered and was discharged.",,,1

- Date of Admission: [redacted]
- Date of Discharge: [redacted]
- Reason for Admission: Mass over the superior aspect of the right scapula

Hospital Course:
The patient, an 80-year-old female, was admitted to the clinic with a mass over the superior aspect of the right scapula. The mass, though achy, did not interfere with performing activities of daily living, but had been enlarging over the previous few months. The patient had no local injuries or recent surgeries on the affected side, and denied having weakness in the left arm or trouble with overhead activities. A similar mass on the contralateral side was excised 10 years previously with favorable results. Inspection of the area was unremarkable, but palpation revealed a firm, nonmobile, and nonpulsatile mass, which was slightly tender upon deeper pressure. Shoulder examination showed no signs of rotator cuff weakness or shoulder pain. X-ray revealed narrowing of the posterior glenohumeral joint space, which was consistent with osteoarthritic changes. MRI revealed an elongated cystic lesion arising from the AC joint and tracking medially to superficial and within the trapezius muscle. The lesion measured 2 cm (AP) × 13 cm (transverse) × 1.8 cm (craniocaudad), and had peripheral enhancement. There was also suspected full-thickness tear of the anterior fibers of the supraspinatus.

Treatment:
The patient underwent excision of the mass via a general anesthetic. Careful dissection revealed a stalk emanating from the AC joint, which was identified and dissected free. The mass was removed en bloc, and a distal clavicle excision was performed using an oscillating saw. After the cyst was excised, it was incised revealing thick mucoid content. Postsurgery, the patient reported immediate pain relief and continued to have full and pain-free range of motion with no signs of recurrence during follow-up visits at three weeks and three months.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was diagnosed with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) by urologists and was referred to our center for pain treatment. During the first consultation, the patient reported experiencing pain, pollakisuria, dysuria, and a foreign body sensation perineally and in the areas of the prostate and anus for over 35 years. Additionally, the patient complained of a burning sensation in the urethra, a slightly reduced urinary stream, and nocturia of varying frequency. 

The patient underwent various specialist urological examinations over the years, including nerve stimulation therapy, empirical antibiotic therapies, analgesics, probatory surgical removal of both seminal vesicles, and an extension surgery on the anus, all of which did not improve the pain or other symptoms. Therefore, urologists referred the patient to our center for a probatory pain treatment with local anesthetics (neural therapy).

The patient was experiencing a particularly severe pain phase at the time of the first consultation with us, and the quality of life was severely affected. The patient was taking an analgesically effective antiepileptic drug, Gabapentin, as well as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, the opioid Oxycodone, and the pain-modifying tricyclic antidepressant, Amitriptyline for the past nine years. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) resulted in 39 points (pain: 18; urinary symptoms: 10; quality of life impact: 11).

Our treatment consisted of suprapubic injection of local anesthetic (1% procaine) for six times initially once a month, and bimonthly later, which was performed on the right and the left with infiltration of the vesicoprostatic plexus (in line with neural therapy). Just a few minutes after the first injection, the pain decreased significantly and persistently to a level the patient had not experienced in years. The pain and other symptoms continued to decrease with each injection.

At the next consultation after two weeks, NIH-CPSI resulted in 11 points (pain: 3; urinary symptoms: 4; quality of life impact: 4). Relapses occurred less frequently, were significantly lower in intensity, and the duration was significantly shorter with an average of three days. Even the symptom-free intervals were getting longer. The patient reduced Diclofenac and Oxycodone on his own initiative and completely discontinued both drugs after the fifth consultation. After seven treatments, he was also able to stop Gabapentin and Amitriptyline and remained free of discomfort (NIH-CPSI: 0 points), which also had a positive effect on his mental and social integrity.

The patient exhibited no adverse effects, and the treatment was well-tolerated. The patient was discharged after completing the treatment course with no further follow-up appointments scheduled.",,,1

Admission Diagnosis:
The 5-year old female was admitted with progressive deterioration in her motor and mental function. Her previous medical history was unremarkable, with no obvious signs of illness up to 2.5 years of age. However, from the age of 2.5 years, after suffering a little finger injury, the patient exhibited a gradual loss of speech and communication abilities. At 3.5 years she developed stereotypic movements. MRI revealed diffuse white matter lesions and hypoplasia of the lower cerebellar vermis. A diagnosis of Rett syndrome was initially suggested, but subsequent tests failed to reveal any abnormalities. At 5 years 8 months, the patient was admitted with a severe deterioration in her motor and mental function.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with no interest in environment, no play activity, absence of orientation in space and time, and disturbed speech and understanding of speech. Her condition further deteriorated, leading to myoclonus in her hands, legs and facial muscles. Tactile stimulation was found to enhance the myoclonus. The patient was unable to walk, stand, or crawl, only able to hold her head, roll over, and sit with periodic falls. An ophthalmological assessment revealed partial atrophy of optic nerves, nistagmus, retinitis pigmentosa and mixed astigmatism. An EEG revealed a significant delay in the formation of cortical electrogenesis and poorly-structured epileptiform activity. MRI revealed cortical atrophy, periventricular leukopathy of both hemispheres of the brain and atrophy of the cerebellum. An ECG showed severe sinus bradyarrhythmia and a variable heart rate.

Discharge Diagnosis:
The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of progressive neurological disease, with no specific known etiology.

Hospital Course in brief:
The patient presented initially with a gradual loss of speech, followed by the appearance of stereotypic movements. Further deterioration led to an inability to walk or crawl, the presence of myoclonus, retinal abnormalities and arrhythmia. Upon discharge, the patient was diagnosed with a progressive neurological disease, with no known root cause established.

Summary:
In summary, the 5-year old female patient was admitted with gradually progressive neurological deterioration, resulting in a severe reduction of her speech, motor function and overall communication abilities.

An 11-year-old Taiwanese girl was admitted to our hospital in May 2013 with fever, dyspnea, and impending respiratory failure. Physical examination revealed several nodular lesions on the abdomen and an enlarged nodular lesion over the right shoulder. Complete blood count showed high leukocytosis with 78% segmented neutrophils. C-reactive protein level was very high, and serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated. High-resolution computed tomography showed multiple lung opacities, mediastinal, cervical, and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed no lymphoma cells, but lymph node biopsies confirmed ALK+ ALCL diagnosis. Treatment involved chemotherapy with several alternating regimens. After initial treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, and intrathecal administration of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone, the patient achieved complete remission after 4 months. New skin lesions were later noted in the lower back, and ALCL relapse was confirmed by skin biopsy 28 months after the initial treatment. Further treatment consisted of chemotherapy with high-dose CHOP alternating with one course of standard ESHAP. After completion, the patient underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Before transplantation, the patient had residual skin lesions suggesting a partial remission, and bone marrow biopsy revealed no residual lymphoma cells.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 47-year-old female of Chinese ethnicity, was admitted in January 2018 due to persistent cough and breathlessness. A chest CT scan revealed multiple abnormalities in both lungs, including a large mass on the upper right lobe. Nodular thickening of the interlobular septa and fissures, along with bilateral pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy, were also observed. After testing, the patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with extensive dissemination in the chest. A next-generation sequencing conducted on malignant pleural effusion (MPE) identified a SDC4-ROS1 fusion gene, and the patient was orally administered crizotinib, after which the symptoms improved significantly.
 
However, on the tenth day of medication, the patient had a low-grade fever and slight aggravation of dyspnoea, and a chest CT re-scan revealed multiple new-onset ground-glass opacities and consolidations throughout both lungs. The patient was then treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam to exclude the possibility of infection. A re-examination of blood tumour markers, and characteristics of hydrothorax, combined with percutaneous lung biopsy, showed acute lung injury and the pathological stage was assumed to be a transition from exudation to organization. Accordingly, MP pulse therapy (0.5 g once per day) was immediately substituted for the original crizotinib treatment and applied for three days. 

However, due to progressive deterioration leading to respiratory failure, the patient was tracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated. All necessary and additional treatment procedures were conducted to prevent ILD. The patient died 20 days after the first administration of crizotinib. Upon approval of the family, a next-generation sequencing analysis of a lung biopsy sample was performed, which revealed a de novo exon 19 deletion mutation in EGFR, not detected in MPE before treatment with crizotinib. On the other hand, the frequency of ROS1 rearrangement decreased after crizotinib treatment.

Name: [Redacted]
Age: 61
Gender: Male
Race: Caucasian

History of Present Illness:
The patient was referred to the Oral Pathology and Medicine Unit due to white oral lesions that were initially thought to be a fungal infection. The patient received treatment based on topical antifungals without significant clinical improvement. Clinical examination showed a thickened hyperkeratosis which was confluent in widely exophytic papillary plaques. These lesions appeared homogeneously whitish-gray with verrucous surface and localized on the maxillary gingiva and palatal and alveolar ridge mucosa. The biopsy samples revealed exophytic, hyperkeratotic lesions with prominent verruciform or papillary surface and acanthosis forming droplet-shaped epithelial projections into the lamina propria. One portion of the gingival biopsy specimen, previously frozen, was used for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) extraction. Human papillomavirus DNA presence was confirmed.

Past Medical History:
The patient has had an appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and tonsillectomy. The patient has never smoked or used drugs recreationally and does not drink alcohol.

Hospital Course:
The excision of the lesion has been performed under local anesthesia using a diode laser set at 1.5 W and a pulse length of 20ms. No postoperative complications were observed, and a periodic follow-up every 6 months has been scheduled. At the last oral examination, 2 years after surgery, we found no signs of loss of alveolar process in correspondence of the surgical ablation site, whereas a mild hyperkeratosis of the maxillary vestibular gingiva was clinically objectified. The microscopic examination performed on a tissue specimen taken in the same area of the laser treatment showed no signs of epithelial dysplasia.

Hospital Course:

The 7-year old male patient from Miandoab, Iran was admitted to the Shahid Abbasi teaching Hospital with febrile serial generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He was stabilized using bolus doses of phenobarbital and phenytoin, but his consciousness level decreased, necessitating endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. He was then transferred to Urmia’s Motahari Hospital. 

Upon evaluation, the patient was suffering from a deep coma, but his vital signs were normal. His pupils were dilated with inadequate response to light, the liver was palpable about 4cm below the costal margin; his muscular tone severely diminished, and deep tendon reflexes were undetectable. Routine laboratory tests revealed nonketotic hypoglycemia and elevated liver enzymes. 

Further investigations were conducted to ascertain the cause of hypoglycemia. The endocrinology consultation ruled out lipid malabsorption, respiratory chain disorder, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes and hyperinsulinemia. Laboratory tests suggested by our pediatric gastroenterologist to detect the viral or immune cause of hepatitis revealed nothing, and the urine toxicology screening test was negative. 

Further investigation was conducted to rule out inherited inborn errors of metabolism. Dried blood spot samples were sent to a lab in Germany for tandem mass spectrometry, which revealed elevated levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines, consistent with medium-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD). 

The patient's older male sibling had also passed away five years ago due to similar symptoms, which further strengthened the possibility of MCADD. Unfortunately, the patient died two days after admission due to multiple organ system failures. Molecular genetics verification was impossible due to the patient's death.

Discharge Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with MCADD, a rare but potentially life-threatening metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for breaking down medium-chain fatty acids for energy production. The condition can lead to a decreased production of glucose, leading to hypoglycemia and subsequent multiple organ system failures.

Discharge Instructions:

Given the sudden and tragic nature of the patient's passing, there was no opportunity to provide discharge instructions. 

Follow-up Care:

There is no requirement for follow-up care as the patient passed away.

Diagnosis: TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma and central hyperthyroidism

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 55-year-old man, was admitted to the hospital after being transferred from a local hospital due to incidentally discovered AF. After receiving radiofrequency ablation for his AF, the patient was found to have hormonal imbalances indicating thyrotoxicosis, a positive result for TSH receptor antibody, and a thyroid gland that was diffusely enlarged with a nodule located in the left lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy suggested that the nodule was benign. Upon further examination, an MRI of the sella region revealed a pituitary tumor measuring 2.3 × 1.7 × 2.2 cm3 in the sella, involving the cavernous sinuses and extending into the suprasellar cistern. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma and central hyperthyroidism.

One week after diagnosis, the patient underwent transsphenoidal neurosurgery to remove the pituitary macroadenoma. The resected pituitary adenoma cells were found to be positive for TSH and PRL antibodies, with the percentage of positive Ki-67 being less than 2%, indicating that the tumor was benign. After surgery, the patient's TSH levels and thyroid hormone levels returned to within the normal ranges.

One year after surgery, the patient's thyroid hormone levels increased beyond the normal ranges, although no residual tumor was found on MRI. Additionally, positive results were obtained for TRAb, and both TgAb and TPOAb were elevated beyond their normal ranges. The patient was prescribed thyrozol 10 mg/day, which was effective in keeping thyroid function tests within normal ranges during 3 years of follow-up.

During the patient's hospital course, there were no significant complications. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue taking thyrozol 10 mg/day and to follow up with an endocrinologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Disposition:

The patient was discharged to home in stable condition with instructions to follow up with an endocrinologist. The patient was prescribed thyrozol 10 mg/day, and instructed to continue taking the medication as prescribed.

Diagnosis: Joint Infection, B. vietnamiensis

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 67-year-old male with a medical history significant for gout, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, was admitted to the hospital after a fall resulting in acute worsening of pain in his right knee. On examination, the patient was found to have a swollen right knee and a significantly increased serum creatinine. Laboratory testing also revealed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance as well as elevated C-reactive protein. Urine dipstick showed positive blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrite. Urine culture identified B. vietnamiensis, a B. cepacia complex organism.

During his hospitalization, the patient's right knee became increasingly swollen and painful. Treatment for gout was ineffective, and a joint aspiration was performed, which revealed purulent fluid and intracellular calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Culture grew B. vietnamiensis. Susceptibility testing indicated minimum inhibitory concentration values in the susceptible range for meropenem, levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ceftazidime, and minocycline. Irrigation and debridement of the knee joint was performed, and the patient received three days of empiric meropenem followed by six weeks of ceftazidime therapy.

The patient's knee pain improved significantly, and he left the hospital against medical advice after completing twenty-eight days of antibiotic therapy. By the time of discharge, the patient's leukocyte and C-reactive protein levels had normalized.

Recommendations:

1. Follow up with primary care physician for regular monitoring and management of gout, hypertension, and osteoarthritis.

2. Continue with antibiotic therapy as directed.

Patient N. 2, a 60-year-old female diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) for ten years, was admitted for evaluation of irritating symptoms of eye discomfort. Symptoms were scored as 74 out of 100 on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and 85 mm out of 100 on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in the right eye (RE) and 22 out of 100 on OSDI and 21 mm out of 100 on VAS in the left eye (LE). Slit lamp evaluation revealed reduced Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) in both eyes. The patient had been previously treated with various tear substitutes but none were successful in symptom relief. A therapy with hyaluronic acid (HA) based tear substitute was prescribed four times per day in both eyes.

In March 2016, the patient was proposed to receive compassionate unconventional therapy with topical CBS in the right eye (RE) to relieve pain symptoms for which the previous therapeutic attempts had turned out to be unsuccessful. The therapy in the contralateral left eye (LE) was maintained with HA based tear substitutes. The patient signed a specifically designed informed consent for the CBS eye drops administration and the posology of 0.4 ml (8 drops) in RE was given each day for two months. In the GFdosages determined for the two CBS lots were administered during the first and second month.

In September 2016, the patient reported a significant relief from subjective symptoms of discomfort. The OSDI score in the RE was 28 out of 100 and VAS was 32 mm out of 100. In the LE, OSDI score was 16 out of 100 and VAS was 15 mm out of 100. During this visit, IOP was measured which resulted in the normal range in both eyes and the analyses of the visual field tests performed since 2006. A significant progressive lowering in MD values was observed, which was followed by an important amelioration in correspondence with the period of CBS therapy, either in the treated right eye or in the untreated left eye. Furthermore, a change was recorded in PSD values after the CBS eye drop treatment in both the treated RE and the untreated LE.

The improvement is also demonstrated by the analysis of the visual field tests before, at the end, and four months from the end of the CBS eye drop treatment. An amelioration of the visual field defect was observed in both the treated RE and the untreated LE.

Overall, the patient's response to the CBS therapy was positive, which could suggest a neural cross-talk mechanism between the eyes. The patient was discharged in stable condition.",,,1

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 20-year-old Sri Lankan male, was admitted to our unit with a complaint of weakness in both hands for one month. He had previously been treated for dengue fever at a local hospital and had made a full recovery. However, five days after discharge, he began to experience weakness in his right hand, which subsequently progressed over time. He presented with an inability to write or button his shirt due to the weakness of his hands. The patient also reported mild weakness in both feet that did not significantly interfere with walking. He did not present with any accompanying numbness, parasthesia or pain.

On general examination, the patient had an average build with no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or signs of malnutrition. The patient showcased some small muscle wasting of bilateral hands and feet. The patient had diminished power asymmetrically graded as 3 out of 5 in the right hand and 4 out of 5 in the left hand. Additionally, all fine finger movements were affected along with some degree of weakness in wrist extension. The patient showcased diminished power grade 4 in distal lower limbs (feet). Bilateral foot dorsiflexion was weak, while ankle jerks were elicited with reinforcement. Knee jerks were elicited without reinforcement and there was no objective sensory impairment of touch, pain, temperature, vibration, and joint position sensations in both upper and lower limbs. No cerebellar signs were demonstrated and his gait showed a minimal degree of high-stepping due to weak dorsiflexion. 

Blood tests revealed white blood cell count: 8.5 × 109/L, platelet count: 274 × 109/L, hemoglobin 12 g/dl with normal red cell indices. The blood picture showed normochromic normocytic cells with some reactive lymphocytes suggestive of a recent viral infection. CSF analysis did not show any increase in proteins or cells and the values were within the normal limits. Anti-GM1 IgM antibody test was not carried out due to the high cost of the test and the patient’s unstable financial background. 

Based on the findings, the patient was diagnosed with multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks. The patient was referred to the neurologist and started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy (2 g/kg/day) which was given for 5 days. He showed improvement in his neurological weakness with the treatment and outpatient physiotherapy was arranged.

Final Diagnosis: Hypoglycemia due to Direct Acting Antiviral Agents

Summary of Hospital Course:

The patient, a 73-year-old female with a history of DM, presented to our clinic complaining of low sugar episodes. She had been receiving insulin therapy for 7 years and had undergone liver transplantation 20 months ago due to HCV infection genotype 1b. Her insulin therapy included intensive subcutaneous insulin injections four times daily, including insulin glargine and insulin aspart. After receiving direct acting antiviral agents (DAAs), the patient began to experience severe hypoglycemia and therefore, the insulin aspart was stopped. The patient discontinued insulin glargine 1 week ago due to persistent hypoglycemia.

During the hospital course, the patient's vital signs were normal and physical examination was unremarkable. Biochemical analysis showed fasting plasma glucose (FG) of 105 mg/dl and postprandial glucose of 200 mg/dl. Glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 4.8%, and c-peptide was 3.17 ng/ml. Liver and renal function test results were within the normal reference range. Home blood glucose measurements also showed a normal course of glucose, and the patient was followed only by dietary regulation.

Based on the clinical presentation of the patient, a final diagnosis of hypoglycemia due to direct acting antiviral agents was made. According to the patient's doctor, the patient was discharged with detailed instructions on diet and glucose monitoring. She was advised to schedule an outpatient follow-up with her endocrinologist for further glycemic management.

Instructions:

1. The patient is advised to continue glucose monitoring at home.
2. The patient should maintain a healthy diet as advised by the nutritionist.

Gender: Female
Race: Asian American

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital for the evaluation of elevated transaminases. Extensive laboratory workup revealed dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hepatomegaly with severe hepatic steatosis. The ultrasound-guided liver biopsy showed severe macrosteatosis with mild lobular and periportal inflammation associated with focal hepatocyte damage and stage II fibrosis. The patient was instructed to exercise routinely and follow a healthy diet.

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 31-year-old Asian American female with a past medical history of chewing betel leaf with betel nuts and non-smoker, who immigrated to the USA from Burma four years previously. The patient reported no previous history of liver test abnormality or liver disease. She reported rare consumption of alcohol and was not using any hepatotoxic prescription or over-the-counter medications or supplements. Besides, she had no family history of liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma, autoimmune disorders, or diabetes mellitus.

Physical Examination:
The physical examination was significant for obesity with weight 66 kg, height 146 cm, body mass index (BMI) 31, hepatomegaly, nonpalpable spleen, and lack of stigmata of chronic liver disease. Physical examination at follow-up visit revealed dark brownish-red pigment on the teeth, tongue, and oral mucosa.

Diagnostic Studies:
Extensive laboratory workup revealed normal complete blood count, renal function, serum electrolytes, iron studies, serum immunoglobulin levels, and ceruloplasmin. Also, hepatitis B and C serologic tests and autoimmune markers were negative. Fasting lipid profile revealed dyslipidemia. Fasting blood glucose was elevated with simultaneous fasting insulin level, thus has insulin resistance. Hemoglobin (Hgb) A1c level was high.

Imaging Studies:
Ultrasonographic evaluation of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly, hyperechogenic liver indicative of severe hepatic steatosis, an ill-defined liver mass, and standard spleen size. Magnetic resonance examination defined the liver mass as hemangioma in addition to hepatomegaly and severe hepatic steatosis.

Hospital Course:
The patient was instructed to exercise routinely and follow a healthy diet. The patient was seen in follow-up for three months at which time her weight was unchanged. Upon questioning the patient about the finding of dark brownish-red pigment on the teeth, tongue, and oral mucosa, she admitted to chewing betel on an average of 10 times per day for the last eight years. The patient reported an associated weight gain of around 16 kg from her baseline weight maintained for many years. This significant weight gain could not be reversed despite daily physically demanding work and following a healthy diet recommended by her primary care physician.

This is a case report of a 44-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006 and underwent modified radical mastectomy after excisional biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient was found to have metastatic lung cancer secondary to breast cancer in June 2010, which was treated with an ovariectomy and exemestane. The patient complained of severe cough in March 2014 and was found to have metastases in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as a malignant renal mass. Various chemotherapy regimens were employed, but all failed. A biopsy of the metastatic lesion was performed, confirming lung metastasis of breast cancer with increased expression of ER. The patient was started on fulvestrant and zoledronic acid injections in August 2015, and a partial response was achieved with shrinking of the renal mass and improvement in subjective symptoms. The patient was stable for 16 months until December 2016 when she decided to stop taking fulvestrant. The patient died of epilepsia gravior due to brain metastases in November 2018 after being treated with apatinib.

1688,"Hospital Course:

The patient was a recipient of a deceased donor kidney transplant from a 50-year-old man who had a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, and relapse of C. difficile infection. Due to his potential as a kidney donor, his kidneys were accepted for transplant. However, his liver and heart were not used as grafts. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and the immunosuppression regimen included basiliximab, methylprednisolone, CyA, and MMF.

Despite good graft perfusion, the patient suffered from delayed graft function and required hemodialysis on day 2 after transplantation. An empirical treatment with ceftriaxone was started and later switched to meropenem as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture from the donor. The patient developed filamentous fungi on a culture plate of the donor's respiratory sample, which was diagnosed as Aspergillus fumigatus. Renal biopsies from the patient were assessed and found to be normal. However, further examination using specific fungal stains revealed filamentous fungi, which confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus by the histopathologist.

Due to the potential presence of invasive aspergillosis (IA), elective nephrectomy was performed on day + 3. The surgery was uneventful, and the graft and vascular sutures were resected. The kidney was found to contain several parenchyma cavitations. A. fumigatus was isolated in samples from the cortex and vascular sutures, and real-time PCR was positive for Aspergillus spp. in both cases. Both patients were followed for 1 year and remain asymptomatic.

Diagnosis:

Delayed graft function due to nephroangiosclerosis, hepatitis C associated–membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation with 3 HLA mismatches.

Treatment:

Basiliximab, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus, and MMF immunosuppressive treatment was initiated along with liposomal-amphotericin B for patient 1 to minimize drug interactions with azole derivatives and the immunosuppressive therapy he received for the LTx. Voriconazole was chosen for patient 2 on day 1, followed by dosage adjustment as needed.

Medical history: No pathological history reported

Principal Diagnosis:

- Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 6-year-old boy with no history of pathological conditions, was admitted to our hospital after suffering an accidental fall from a 3-meter climbing pole. He experienced pain and deformity in the right elbow and wrist joints and was diagnosed with Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna.

The patient received manual reduction under nerve block on the day of injury, but due to the difficulty of maintaining the reduction of the radial head, open reduction and percutaneous procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Kirschner wires were inserted for open reduction and fixation of the fractured distal radius and ulna. A long-arm cast was used for external fixation with the elbow in 90° flexion and the forearm in an intermediate position.

After 2 weeks, callus formation at the fractured bone was observed, and therefore, the cast was removed, and range of motion exercises of the elbow and wrist joints were initiated. The Kirschner wires were removed at 6 weeks postsurgery, and pain, range of motion limitation, and lateral instability were not observed in the elbow or wrist joints at 3 months after surgery.

During the 3-year follow-up, radiographs showed a gradual correction in the outward displacement of the radial head. Twenty-one years after surgery, the patient returned to our hospital for another disorder, and radiographs of the previous Monteggia injury were taken. The biocompatibility of the radiocapitellar joint was good, and no malunion was found in the distal radius and ulna.

Patient:
A 71-year-old Qatari male

Diagnosis:
Oral cavity Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
Stage cT4 N0 M0

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital on the 12th of January 2017 for a second-line treatment with nivolumab. The treatment was started after declining chemotherapy due to post-radiation necrosis and neck fistula experienced in previous treatments.

Tests and Investigations:
Two CT scans of the patient neck were taken before treatment and 10 days after the fifth cycle of the treatment. PET CT scan was carried out 239 days after the fifth cycle (7 months, 25 days) of treatment. The antibody response to the NY-ESO-1 antigen was measured in the plasma using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a known immunogenic NY-ESO-1 peptide. The cellular response to the NY-ESO-1 antigen was investigated in patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by T cells against the NY-ESO-1 overlapping peptides. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of PD-1 in the patient CD3+ T cells before and after nivolumab treatment. A panel of 27 plasma biomarkers (cytokines and chemokines) was analyzed by multiplex analysis.

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with oral HNSCC and underwent radiotherapy in London, UK in 1997 with a recurrence of the cancer in 2016 involving the supraglottic region and tongue base.

Clinical Findings:
After the fifth cycle of nivolumab treatment, the patient’s bleeding stopped and CT scan follow-up showed stable disease, no progression, or distant metastasis. PET CT scan showed a mild increase in size which suggests pseudo-progression. However, patient's condition deteriorated within time with the development of cough, blood discharge and the soft tissue mass in the neck was also observed on visits.

Laboratory Results:
ELISA results showed that the NY-ESO-1 antibody levels significantly reduce after treatment as well there was a significant decrease in IFN-γ secretion at progression.

Management and Treatment:
The patient was treated with nivolumab after declining chemotherapy. However, due to non-compliance the patient refused further treatment after the fifth cycle.

Summary:
The 71-year-old Qatari male patient was admitted for second-line treatment with nivolumab after declining chemotherapy due to post-radiation necrosis and neck fistula.

Admission Disposition: Medical Department

Chief Complaint: Persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor

History of Present Illness: The patient, a 20-year-old Caucasian male, was admitted to the medical department with persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor. The symptoms had started at home four days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. The laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, AST 150 UI/L, and ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission, and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein. On the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF spectrometry.

Hospital Course: The patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations. A multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre’s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The source control includes an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess under general anesthesia and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. The patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and required mechanical ventilation. About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole was added to piperacillin/tazobactam. Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin. There was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved. Despite the adequate mean arterial pressure, there was a new worsening of the clinical status featured anemia without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring showed a hyperdynamic septic state. Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, hydrocortisone was added to argipressin and norepinephrine, leading to paramount hemodynamic improvement. Continuous hemofiltration was carried out to treat the inflammatory response by four cycles. Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia monitoring and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy. On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion, and a new CT showed a persistence of known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program.

Hospital course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with persistent gastrointestinal discomfort, fever, and severe lower abdominal pain. Upon arrival at the emergency room, she showed symptoms of abdominal distension and diffuse tenderness on her left side. The patient had no underlying diseases but had previously undergone transvaginal sonography that revealed a teratoma-like ovarian mass on her left side. She had undergone TVOR and frozen embryo transfer as part of her IVF treatment before admission. Computed tomography showed a mixed-density mass with calcifications and a discontinuous border over her left adnexa, consistent with clinical suspicion of a ruptured teratoma. 

The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she was initially suspected to have severe sepsis with acute kidney injury. Antibiotics were changed, and she underwent exploratory laparoscopy. Purulent fluid was found in her peritoneal cavity, and a ruptured teratoma was observed near her left adnexa. The surgery was challenging due to significant adhesions caused by active inflammation, and it was not possible to visualize or remove the ruptured cyst.

Post-surgery, the patient developed bilateral pleuritis with a bloody background, likely caused by the chemical irritation of the spilled contents of the teratoma. The patient's condition improved over the course of her hospital stay, although she experienced intermittent fever, mild abdominal pain, and sporadic shortness of breath for the following two weeks.

Hypercortisolism was suspected.

The provisional diagnosis of ECS was confirmed by a 24-hour urine cortisol level, serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression, and loss of physiologic diurnal variation. ACTH-independent CS was determined by an ACTH level. CT of the upper abdomen showed bilateral adrenal nodules. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) revealed a predominantly left-sided ratio of adrenal venous to peripheral plasma cortisol. The patient also had a compression fracture of the T5-T10 vertebrae and osteolytic lesions in her ribs and pelvic bones, which resulted in the suspicion of metastatic cancers and MM.

Further diagnostic investigations revealed Kappa light chain MM, International Staging System stage I. The patient was prioritized for MM treatment using the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD) regimen. The treatment was recycled every 28 days with a total of six cycles, after which a very good partial response was achieved. An autologous stem cell transplant was performed.

Five months after the stem cell transplant, the patient underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy, where a left adrenal cortical adenoma was identified. She received a steroid replacement, which was gradually discontinued over 9 months. Her blood pressure decreased slowly, and she was successfully tapered off the anti-hypertensive drugs over 2 months. Her Cushingoid appearance gradually subsided, and she was in remission of both diseases after more than 30 months of treatment.

Outcome:

The patient was discharged upon achieving remission. She had a complete response to the intervention and was doing well at the time of discharge. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her progress.

Final Diagnosis:

Cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma
Multiple Myeloma of stage I. 

Treatment:

The patient was treated with the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD) regimen and underwent autologous stem cell transplant. She then underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Steroid replacement was administered which was gradually discontinued over 9 months. Blood pressure medication was tapered off.  

Discharge Instructions:

The patient should continue to attend follow-up appointments to monitor her progress. She should follow the prescribed medication and treatment plan. She should also maintain a healthy lifestyle, diet, and regular exercise. The patient was advised to notify the doctor in case of any unusual symptoms or discomfort.",,,1

Diagnosis: Bovine viral diarrhea virus persistent infection (BVDV-PI)

Hospital Course:
The patient, an 11-month-old female PI calf, was admitted to the Veterinary Hospital of the Department of Veterinary Medicine of the University of Bari, Italy on 12 April 2021 for diagnostic confirmation of BVDV PI. The calf had been identified in a herd of Apulia region, Italy, that consisted of 99 Alpine Brown cattle, all under the age of 1 year. The patient had undergone virological and bacteriological investigations before arrival, which revealed the presence of BVDV and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Upon arrival, the patient was hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Unit and clinically examined two times a day during the entire period of hospitalization. The patient was kept in a separate room with straw bedding, was fed a commercial concentrate twice daily, and had access to haylage and water ad libitum. The facility was closed for other animals and had restricted admission for people. Two days after arrival, the patient showed hyperthermia (39.8 °C), and additional samples were collected to monitor its health status and to assess the presence of concomitant virological/bacteriological infections.

Diagnostic Findings:
The presence of BVDV and BCoV was confirmed in nasal swabs, fecal swabs, and EDTA-treated blood collected from the patient, and BVDV antibodies were detected in serum samples.

Treatment:
The patient did not receive any specific treatment for BVDV-PI during hospitalization.

History and Presenting Problem: 
This 5-year-old boy with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presented with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), joint hyperlaxity, and morphogenetic anomalies. The patient’s mother had a history of epilepsy with tonic–clonic seizures, photosensitivity, and moderate elevation in serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels following physical exercise.

Assessment and Findings: 
The patient was born from non-consanguineous parents after an uneventful dizygotic twin pregnancy. He had delayed milestones and showed a lack of eye contact, visual tracking, and social interest from early on. EEG showed focal spikes over the frontal region and the left temporal region and generalized spike-and-wave complexes during sleep. A brain MRI showed normal results. Muscular dystrophy was confirmed through genetic analysis of the dystrophin gene which detected the deletion of exons 46-51 of the gene. The child presented with severe developmental delays and autistic features, including poor eye contact, absence of protodeclarative pointing, attention deficit, and inadequate social-communicative abilities. Joint hyperlaxity and peculiar facial traits were noted, including a high forehead, epicanthic folds, deep-set eyes, an elongated face, and large ears. Following array-CGH analysis and FMR1 molecular analysis, the comorbidity with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) was confirmed.

Address: [insert address]

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection of T/NK-cell type, systemic form.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted due to a seizure and a history of wasting and worsening health condition for six months. Upon admission, he presented with recurrent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and acute kidney failure. The patient underwent several diagnostic approaches, including CT scan, PET-CT, bone marrow biopsy, and thyroid gland biopsy. These examinations revealed atypical pulmonary infiltrates, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, increased LDH, mild pancytopenia, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Bronchial lavage was positive for Aspergillus antigen, but the patient's symptoms were not fully explained by pulmonary aspergillosis. The high positive proteinase 3 titer (1:135) indicated granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but biopsy of the kidney was not performed due to low platelet counts.

The patient was treated with high-dose steroid burst initially. However, the patient's condition worsened rapidly with further loss of weight and intermittent high fever despite antibiotic and antifungal treatments, and the assumption of granulomatosis with polyangiitis was ruled out. Infectious disease testing, including human immunodeficiency virus, Tuberculosis, Schistosomiasis, Malaria, and Leishmaniosis were negative, except for previous Hepatitis B and EBV infection. EBV DNA in the peripheral blood reached high levels. The clinical criteria for HLH were evaluated, but they were not fulfilled, and no typical findings of HLH were seen in the bone marrow biopsy. 

Treatment:
Based on the data by Sawada et al., the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide as a cooling down step to reduce the high viral load. The patient developed an epileptic seizure and clinical symptoms of meningitis, and a lumbar puncture was performed. Cranial MRI showed typical radiological signs for viral meningitis. The patient was initiated chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) due to the clinical progression. Despite its limited activity for EBV-infection, treatment with foscavir was started. Upon two cycles of CHOP, the EBV load decreased remarkably from 2.8 × 106 copies/mL to < 200 copies/mL. An additional cycle of CHOP was administered and the patient remained in complete remission so far.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with their physician regularly. Further diagnostic imaging, laboratory work, or close clinical follow-up may be required to monitor the patient's condition.

Discharge Instructions:
1. Follow up with your physician regularly.
2. Take medications as prescribed.
3. Report any new symptoms or concerns to your physician immediately.
4. Maintain a healthy diet and exercise regularly.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to our hospital with a one-year history of right ankle pain following trauma due to a car accident. The patient had previously undergone open reduction and internal fixation in his right ankle for a fracture at another hospital. His ankle pain persisted despite the intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy, and fixation implant removal performed at our hospital. The patient was diagnosed with progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond. A surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended, and three months later, the patient underwent an osteochondral graft procedure on his right ankle. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and a range of motion exercises were initiated immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks. The patient was able to return to standing work 10 months after surgery. The most recent magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 years after surgery showed that the cartilage in the anterolateral joint surface was almost intact, and there was no osteonecrosis. The patient remained asymptomatic with respect to the donor sites of the right knee. On the latest physical examination, the patient complained of mild pain in his right ankle while walking, but could walk for 30 min. The postoperative AOFAS ankle score was 80. The patient was able to return to carpenter's work on a five-day week, but remained with minor ankle pain on standing up and walking for more than half an hour over the 3-year observation period.

Findings:
The radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus, and the computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond. The osteochondral defect was diagnosed as grade 2 according to the classification of the International Cartilage Repair Society.

The patient was admitted to our department primarily with complaints of hoarseness, dysphagia, and foreign-body sensation, which had gradually worsened over a period of 8 months. The patient was a heavy smoker and consumed alcohol frequently without indulging in alcohol abuse. The patient also had arterial hypertension, which was under control with beta blockers.

After a thorough examination of the head and neck, the patient was found to have a lesion affecting both vocal cords and anterior commissure, with vocal cord mobility being impaired. A cervicothoracic and upper abdomen computed tomography scan was ordered, and the patient underwent direct microlaryngoscopy and biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia. The biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma affecting the anterior commissure and thyroid cartilage. Imaging also revealed a second lesion approximately 2 cm below the inferior end of the primary one, which was resected along with the primary tumor following informed consent.

The patient underwent total laryngectomy, wide excision of the trachea, and left thyroid lobectomy, followed by bilateral selective neck dissection (Robin’s levels II–IV) and removal of the paratracheal lymph nodes (Robin’s level VI). The surgical resection margins were free of disease. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on day 16 with normal swallow function.

The final pathological report confirmed that the primary tumor was a glottic carcinoma, while the second tumor had morphological features identical to those of the primary one with an upward infiltrating pattern. The lymph nodes from the left neck dissection specimen showed extracapsular spread, as did many of the neoplastic emboli observed in lymphatics between the two tumors.

The patient was initially treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory therapy and later with 50 mg intravenous hydrocortisone every 12 hours for three days and intravenous fluids for a suspected postviral myositis. The patient was discharged home after his symptoms resolved.

However, the patient was readmitted to a different hospital five days later for dysphagia and concern of aspiration pneumonia. The patient was treated with intravenous ceftriaxone and metronidazole and was sent to a rehabilitation facility. Another four days later, the patient presented to our hospital with worsening pneumonia and neurological symptoms such as decreased proximal muscle and grip strength, weak palate elevation, and diplopia upon prolonged upward gaze. The patient did not exhibit muscle fatigue from repetitive use. Initial evaluation for this patient was unremarkable for brain or cranial nerve lesions, motor neuron disease, neuromuscular junction disorders (NMJ), or other myopathies. The patient was treated with stress-dose steroids, antibiotics, and other supportive measures. Four days after this admission, the antiacetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody (Ab) panel revealed elevated ACR binding and modulating antibodies correlating with diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Titers for AChR binding Ab were elevated at 2.15 nmol/L, and AChR modulating Ab was elevated at 45%. The patient was started on pyridostigmine and plasma exchange (5 exchanges, 3500 ml per exchange). 

Three days into this therapy, the patient developed respiratory failure from MG crisis and worsening aspiration pneumonia. Due to worsening symptoms, the patient requested hospice care, and he passed away soon thereafter.

History of Present Illness:
The patient was experiencing progressively worsening neck pain and numbness of the left upper extremity and the left face for the past 2 weeks. He did not report any recent head or neck injuries. He was followed closely without further treatment, but the symptoms gradually worsened. He visited our hospital for further examination and treatment two months after the onset. 

Past Medical History:
The patient's past medical history was not significant for t2d, htn, or cvd.

Physical Examination:
The neurological examination revealed a mildly spastic gait and exaggerated deep tendon reflexes in the bilateral upper and lower extremities. He also had mild dysuria and constipation. Muscle strength and vibration sense were normal, and no Babinski sign was present.

Diagnostic Tests:
Peripheral blood examination revealed no significant abnormality. Cerebrospinal fluid examination was within normal limits except for slightly elevated protein. Unenhanced CT of the cervicothoracic spine showed diffuse dorsal epidural calcification at C3-T6. The lesion presented as a crescent shape along the spinal dura mater and had a well-defined border along the vertebral arch. On MR imaging, the lesion appeared as a hypointense mass on both pre-contrast T1 and T2 weighted images. The lesion displayed heterogeneous enhancement, and caused cervical spinal canal stenosis. Head CT and MR imaging revealed no significant abnormality.

Hospital Course:
C5/6 laminectomy was performed to biopsy for confirmation. Perioperative findings revealed an intact ligamentum flavum. A solid, grayish-white lesion was found just beneath the ligamentum flavum. Histopathological examination of the specimen demonstrated numerous granular calcium crystals within dense fibrous tissue with myxoid change. Grocott, periodic acid-Schiff and Ziehl-Neelsen stains showed no obvious source of infection (e.g. fungal or tubercular), and there was no evidence of malignancy.

Hospital Course:

This patient, a 51-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and diabetes, presented to the urgent care clinic with a chronic headache that persisted for almost a year. A CT scan of the head revealed no abnormalities, and other potential causes of the headache were ruled out through laboratory tests and imaging. The patient reported a history of head trauma one year prior to symptom onset, but there was no loss of consciousness, and the headache was thought to be related to post-concussion syndrome.

Over the course of the year, the patient visited the emergency department several times with severe headaches, but no underlying cause was identified. The headache was rated as 7/10, intermittent, non-radiating, and throbbing, with frontal location. Treatment with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, tramadol, and Fiorecet had been ineffective.

Upon reconciliation of the patient's medications, it was found that she had been switched from metformin to metformin-sitagliptin almost a year prior to the onset of symptom. Given the temporal association of the medication change and symptom presentation, sitagliptin was discontinued as a trial treatment, and the patient was switched back to metformin. Two days after discontinuation of sitagliptin, the patient reported resolution of her headache.

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CLL. He was admitted with rapidly growing systemic lymphadenopathy with high levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein as well as high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor. He was started on chemotherapy but developed febrile neutropenia. Salvage therapy with BR was started, which resulted in complete remission of both SLL and classic Hodgkin LPDs.

Hospital Course Details:

Admission:

Admitted with rapidly growing systemic lymphadenopathy, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein as well as high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor. 

Procedure:

The right cervical lymph node was surgically excised.

Tests and Results:

Bone marrow aspirate showed massive infiltration of small lymphocytes. FCM analysis revealed that most small lymphocytes in the PB and BM were positive for CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23 and IG light chain. RT-PCR analysis revealed 2300 copies of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA per ml of whole blood. A SB analysis showed the same patterns of rearranged IGH bands amongst samples from the lymph node, the PB, and the BM. Imaging studies showed increased FDG uptake in lymph nodes, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) higher than 8.5 in cervical, mediastinal and paraaortic lymph nodes.

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with CLL (Binet B) with a genetic diagnosis of de novo lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). 

Treatment:

The patient was initially treated with fludarabine alone, then with FCR, and kept in partial remission. Two courses of ABVD were unsuccessful, with a persistently high number of circulating B-CLL cells being documented in the PB, despite chemotherapy. The patient was then started on salvage therapy with BR (90 mg/m2 Bendamustine on days one and two, 375 mg/m2 Rituximab on day one), which resulted in complete remission of both SLL and classic Hodgkin LPDs.

Outcome:

The patient was discharged in a stable condition. Complete remission was confirmed in both SLL and classic Hodgkin LPDs by FDG-PET, which has continued for more than one year so far. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with the treating physicians.",,,1

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and jaundice, and was diagnosed with acute cholecystitis. After undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) and cholecystectomy, the patient continued to experience symptoms. Repeat imaging indicated common bile duct narrowing, and a 20 x 3.5 cm perihepatic abscess was found requiring treatment through percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and biliary drainage. Laboratory studies at that time revealed elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal sodium, potassium, albumin, lipase, and AST/ALT levels. After receiving antibiotics for three weeks, the patient was discharged.

One week later, the patient developed a fever, chills, and leukocytosis and was readmitted to the hospital. Abdominal CT showed multiple fluid collections within the liver parenchyma and a biopsy was performed, showing an epithelioid to spindle cell neoplasm infiltrating between hepatocytes with markedly atypical nuclei and prominent necrosis. Further staining was performed and the tumor cells were negative for various markers. Based on the radiographic features in combination with the biopsy results, it was likely a primary hepatic lesion without differentiation.

A PET/CT was ordered after reviewing the biopsy results and identified a large hepatic mass with potential central necrosis and multifocal liver lesions with hypermetabolic peritoneal implants suggesting peritoneal dissemination. After receiving one cycle of chemotherapy (adriamycin and ifosfamide), the patient experienced severe confusion and refused further treatment. The patient passed away within 19 days of diagnosis.

The patient was given amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, inhaled prednisolone, and salbutamol as medications but the symptoms were only partially reduced. Chest computed tomography showed a mass of parenchymal origin in the lower lobe of the lung invading the left atrium. Transthoracic needle biopsy identified mixed inflammatory cells, and treatment consisting of invasive tumor management was deemed necessary.

Operative Approach:

The patient underwent a left thoracotomy incision and left lower lobectomy was performed to deal with the invasive tumor. A portion of the tumor invading the left atrium was resected along with the intact atrial wall, and the left atrium was repaired with pledgeted sutures. No cardiopulmonary bypass was required.

Histopathological Examination:

After the operation was terminated, the mass was histopathologically examined and identified as an IMT.

Postoperative Period:

The patient's postoperative period was uneventful, and the patient was discharged on the sixth postoperative day.

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with IMT.

Recommendations:

The patient needs to continue follow-up appointments with the relevant specialists to monitor progress and recovery.",,,1

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the dermatology clinic with severe facial acne, rated grade 4 on the Investigator Global Assessment of Acne scale. The patient had been using topical retinoids for several months with no satisfactory results. The patient was started on 20mg isotretinoin, which was maintained for 6 months. The patient presented with mild chelitis and skin dryness, and complained of mild hair fall. Liver enzymes and lipid profile were within the normal range for both the initial laboratory works and the repeated tests done after one month and four months. The patient experienced total clearance of her acne. However, treatment was interrupted because they could not visit the clinic for several weeks.

Two months after stopping the isotretinoin treatment, the patient developed depigmented lesions reminiscent of acrofacial vitiligo. The pattern of the vitiligo persisted despite topical treatment with Antifungal agents, so the patient was prescribed Tacrolimus 0.1% cream, which led to mild improvement of some of the lesions after eight weeks  before recurrence. The patient, in favor of alternative medicine, opted to cease topical treatment and receive homeopathic treatment instead.

Medical History:
Patient had no history of vitiligo but did have a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus. An auntie had died from renal complications of SLE.

Diagnosis:
Acne, severe facial, clearance achieved with isotretinoin
Acrofacial vitiligo with complaints of depigmented lesions

Treatment:
The patient was treated with 20 mg isotretinoin for six months, which led to complete clearance of her acne. The patient then received Antifungal and Tacrolimus 0.1% topical therapy for her vitiligo with mild improvement after eight weeks, but later stopped it in favor of homeopathic treatment.

Follow-up:
Patient was discharged in good condition. The patient was advised to follow up with the medical clinic given their positive thyroid antibodies and family history of lupus.

Discharge medications:
The patient had no discharge medications.

Discharge condition:
Discharged in stable condition.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with urinary diversion through bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies after undergoing laparoscopic surgery for removal of a prostatic utricle cyst, which resulted in anuria. The patient had a history of lower abdominal pain and burning micturition on and off for two years. Following surgical treatment, the patient remained asymptomatic for about 18 months. A recurrence of symptoms was associated with an increase in cyst size. 

Diagnostic Tests and Procedures:
The patient underwent an ascending and micturating cysto-urethrogram which showed a smooth walled bladder with mildly reduced capacity and normal urethra. Urethrocystoscopy showed normal anterior urethra with an opening on verumontanum accommodating a 17-French cystoscope sheath with a smooth walled cavity containing about 200 mL of turbid fluid. MRI pelvis was conducted which revealed the absence of urinary bladder. Bilateral lower ureteric injury was initially suspected as nephrostomogram showed complete cut-off of both lower ureters. 

Treatment Plan and Outcome:
Surgery was discontinued due to the realization of accidental urinary bladder cystectomy instead of prostatic utricular cystectomy. The patient opted for orthotopic neo-bladder, where the prostatic utricle cyst was marsupialized, and its opening into the urethra was closed. Studer's orthotopic ileal neobladder was constructed, and nephrostomies were clamped and removed after postoperative MCU showed good capacity neobladder and no extravasation. At follow-up, the patient was voiding well with minimal residue and no incontinence. The outcomes in terms of ejaculation were yet unknown. 

Conclusion:
The patient was treated surgically and recovered well. At the time of discharge, the patient was advised to continue follow-up visits and to report any complications or issues.",,,1

Admitting Diagnosis: Sclerosing Lymphocytic Lobulitis

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 27-year-old woman, was admitted to our hospital for further investigation upon referral from another hospital where a routine check-up showed changes in the right breast. The patient had a history of left breast cancer diagnosed at the age of 22 and had undergone wide excision, sentinel node procedure, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. A follow-up examination, coinciding with the conclusion of hormonal therapy, showed a multifocal nodular contrast enhancement in the retro-areolar region and the lower-outer quadrant of the right breast. The patient's examination was categorized as BIRADS 4, and follow-up included breast ultrasound every six months and a yearly mammogram and MRI of the breasts.

An ultrasound-assisted core biopsy was performed, which revealed dense lymphocytic infiltrate of predominantly B-lymphocytes surrounding the ductulolobular unit and the vessels, in combination with a fibrous stroma of low cellularity and an increase in fibroblasts. This led to a diagnosis of sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis, with no signs of malignancy detected. 

The patient's hypoechoic lesion on ultrasonography and the multifocal contrast enhancement on MRI gradually diminished over consecutive examinations to a level where it is barely perceptible. The patient was advised to continue regular follow-up examinations.

The patient was discharged on MM/DD/YYYY in stable condition with instructions to continue follow-up examinations as scheduled. Discharge medications included [ OMITTED ]. The patient was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle, which includes regular exercise and a balanced diet, and to report any abnormal symptoms to her healthcare provider.

Diagnosis: Intravenous leiomyomatosis

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with a lower abdominal mass and pain, and was diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma by transcervical needle biopsy. Imaging studies revealed a large heterogeneous tumor occupying the pelvic cavity and an intravascular tumor within the left internal iliac and ovarian veins. The preoperative diagnosis was intravenous leiomyomatosis (IVL) with extension of the tumor into the left internal iliac and ovarian veins.

During surgery, multiple myomas were discovered within the uterine corpus and cervix, and the tumor was found to extend to the parametrium and paracolpium. Detachment of the tumor from the left ureter and vaginal wall was difficult. TAH and BSO were performed, and the left internal iliac vein forming the common iliac vein was transected at the bifurcation region, resulting in complete surgical resection of the tumor. No residual tumor was detected in the venous resection stump. The patient's operative time was 11 hours with a blood loss of 8462 g. 

The histopathological diagnosis of the uterine and intravascular tumors was IVL. The patient demonstrated no evidence of IVL recurrence at their most recent follow-up, which occurred 38 months postoperatively.

Summary of Hospital Course:
-The patient presented with a lower abdominal mass and pain.
-The patient was diagnosed with uterine leiomyoma via needle biopsy.
-Imaging studies revealed a large heterogeneous tumor occupying the pelvic cavity and an intravascular tumor within the left internal iliac and ovarian veins, leading to a diagnosis of IVL.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Oncology for further assessment and evaluation of her metastatic bone disease. She had a history of TNBC and had undergone a wide local excision with sentinel lymph node biopsy, radiotherapy to the right breast, and hormonal therapy. The patient reported having “urticaria pigmentosa” in the past. Various imaging scans, including a DEXA scan, X-ray of the lumbosacral spine, CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis, and an isotope bone scan, were carried out to diagnose and determine the extent of her bony sclerotic foci. The patient was initiated on monthly Zoledronic acid. A repeat CT scan in 2013 and MRI scan of the spine in 2014 showed skeletal metastases. The patient had a history of investigations in the 1990s that revealed SM, leading to initiation of phototherapy. Upon re-examination of imaging, the radiology team concluded that radiological abnormalities were more consistent with SM than metastatic TNBC. The patient was continued on adjuvant letrozole and referred to a rheumatologist for further follow-up on SM.

A 61-year-old male patient with a recent onset of pain, redness, floaters, and decreased vision in his right eye was diagnosed with anterior uveitis and treated with prednisolone acetate eye drops combined with intravenous drip of dexamethasone and cephalosporin. His symptoms worsened over time, and he presented eighteen days later at our facility with severe vision loss in his right eye. He reported a history of heavy drinking, chronic peptic discomfort, and weight loss caused by loss of appetite after abstinence from alcohol. 

During the course of his hospitalization, he was diagnosed with dm2 and treated with Metformin. Blood and serologic tests were done to identify the underlying cause of the patient's eye condition. A presumptive diagnosis of right endophthalmitis was made, and vitreous and anterior chamber taps of the right eye were performed to determine the causative organism. 

The patient underwent an extensive surgical procedure in which pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed, along with phacoemulsification to remove a white elevated fluffy mass with overlying retinal whitening and necrosis in the superior periphery. Careful clearance of the white fluffy mass in superior and peripheral vitreous was achieved without retinal break formation. 

Postoperatively, the patient received topical levofloxacin 0.5% and prednisolone 1% acetate eye drops six times a day, along with atropine 1% ointment at night for the right eye. Results of vitreous samples PCR were positive for Klebsiella pneumonia (KP), confirming the diagnosis of EE caused by KP. An intravitreal injection of ceftazidime 2 mg/0.1 ml on the right eye was performed, and the patient was discharged for follow-up as an outpatient with levofloxacin 0.5% and prednisolone 1% acetate eye drops administered topically for one week. 

Follow-up visits revealed a correctly attached retina, albeit with yellowish subretinal precipitates and a large fibrotic scar superiorly. Epiretinal membrane was also observed in the posterior pole. At eight months, the patient's eye remained quiescent, and his corrected visual acuity was hand motions.",,,1

Patient Name: Not disclosed
Age: Early 70s
Gender: Male

Medical History:
The patient underwent upper endoscopic examination during a routine health checkup, which revealed a submucosal tumor measuring 20 mm in the middle body of the stomach.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the lesion following the detection of a submucosal tumor. Cytology revealed many epithelial cells showing sheet-like clusters or mildly overlapping clusters and isolated scattered cells in a background of inflammatory cells and mucin. The patient underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) after the possibility of a proliferative lesion was considered. Assessment of the ESD specimen revealed a tumor measuring 23 × 15 mm was observed only in the submucosal layer. On the basis of the histology, the tumor was diagnosed as GA-FGM. The margins of the ESD specimen were positive, and total gastrectomy and lymph node dissection were additionally performed.

Treatment:
Total gastrectomy and lymph node dissection were performed on the patient. After treatment, no recurrence was observed during a 1-year follow-up period.

Other Findings:
Numerous heterotopic gastric glands (HGGs) were observed in the stomach wall. In these HGGs, gastric foveolar and fundic gland- or pyloric gland-like epithelia were observed. In the background of the gastric mucosa, atrophy along with intestinal metaplasia was generally observed.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged without any complications. No further treatment was required for the patient during follow-up.
