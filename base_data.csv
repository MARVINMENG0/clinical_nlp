The 60-year-old Japanese male patient was admitted due to dyspnea, tachypnea, hypoxemia, and low-grade fever. Blood tests showed leukocytosis, high C-reactive protein levels, and normal liver and renal function. Imaging tests revealed diffuse ground-glass opacification and consolidation in bilateral lung fields. He received noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation and high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, as well as empiric antibiotics, for an ARDS of unknown etiology.

After 3 days of steroid pulse therapy, the patient significantly improved and was eventually discharged without any symptoms of dyspnea. The steroid was gradually tapered down and discontinued after 7 months.

However, the patient was readmitted in 10 months due to a relapse of dyspnea along with grasping pain in both thighs, proximal muscle weakness in extremities, and elevation of serum creatinine kinase. Imaging tests showed a mixture of diffuse ground-glass opacification and consolidation similar to previous roentgenological patterns. Although the Euroline myositis line blot assay showed negative results for either myositis-specific or myositis-associated antibodies, the short-tau inversion recovery sequence (STIR) of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed inflammatory changes in both hamstring muscles.

Again, after 3 days of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, the patient's dyspnea and muscle weakness improved dramatically and the diffuse abnormal shadows in the chest CT scan and high signal on STIR MRI of the hamstring muscles disappeared. The steroid was gradually tapered down, and the patient was discharged without respiratory and muscular symptoms after 26 days.

 [Summary]

The 60-year-old Japanese male patient was admitted twice for dyspnea and respiratory distress and diagnosed with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) of unknown etiology and a relapse of ARDS along with an initial manifestation of seronegative polymyositis (PM). The patient received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy, which effectively treated both episodes. Imaging and blood tests were performed to evaluate the patient's condition.

Hospital Course:

A 25-year-old male with a history of blurred vision in the right eye, headache, and weight loss of approximately 30 kg was admitted with a suspected craniopharyngioma. Initial MRI showed a tumor located suprasellarly that was not associated with the pituitary gland. Endocrine evaluation revealed secondary hypogonadism and adrenal insufficiency. The tumor was removed, and perioperative frozen section histological examination suggested the tumor to be a possible malignant lymphoma due to lymphocytic infiltration. The patient was transferred to the Department of Endocrinology at Odense University Hospital, where pituitary hormone insufficiency of all anterior axes and diabetes insipidus was diagnosed, and treatment with various hormones was implemented. Final histological diagnosis revealed autoimmune hypophysitis.

Ten months postoperatively, the patient reported impaired vision, and MRI demonstrated that the pituitary remnant tissue was causing pressure on the optic chiasm. Treatment with glucocorticoid pulse therapy was initiated, which was followed by steroid-sparing treatment with azathioprine when the patient had intolerable adverse effects. The patient responded well to treatment, but after an initial reduction in the pituitary mass, there was a recurrence of the mass, and treatment with rituximab was initiated. The patient responded well to rituximab treatment, resulting in almost complete regression of the pituitary mass.

The patient was discharged with the recommendation to follow up with routine imaging and endocrine evaluation. The patient remains in sustained remission with no further complications, with the control MRI showing no evidence of recurrence.

Patient 2, a 32-year-old male with a history of CDH1 mutation and HDGC, presented for prophylactic total gastrectomy. The procedure was completed without complications, and the patient was discharged home on post-operative day 7.

Admission:
The patient returned to the hospital 5 days later with symptoms of diffuse abdominal pain, dark-colored emesis, and no bowel movements for 2 days. Abdominal CT scan revealed a dilated, gas-filled small bowel loop. However, subsequent tests were unremarkable except for elevated amylase and lipase levels, which suggested pancreatitis as a more likely source for his pain. The patient was treated for pancreatitis and discharged without further complications.

Discharge Condition:
At the time of this report, patient 2 is well with no evidence of disease.

Summary:
Patient 2 underwent prophylactic total gastrectomy due to the presence of the CDH1 mutation and HDGC. The pathology report showed microscopic foci of signet ring cells in the lamina propria without the invasion of the submucosa, consistent with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the stomach. After his initial recovery, he was readmitted for abdominal pain, dark-colored emesis, and no bowel movements. A CT scan showed a gas-filled small bowel loop, while elevated amylase and lipase suggested pancreatitis.

The patient, a 79-year-old woman, was admitted for evaluation of abnormal murmur. She presented with a 3-months history of worsening shortness of breath and orthopnea. Physical examination revealed a soft continuous murmur at the left upper chest with basal crackles in both lungs. Chest radiography showed mild cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary congestion. The ECG showed regular sinus rhythm without evidence of ischemia or prior myocardial infarction.
Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a mildly dilated LV with markedly dilated left atrium. The LV ejection fraction was 60% with no wall motion abnormality. Transthoracic echocardiography also showed an unusual, tubular-like structure inside the interventricular septum with a turbulent, predominantly diastolic flow on color Doppler. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed a markedly dilated RCA arising from the right aortic sinus, while the origin of the left coronary artery (LCA) could not be demonstrated. There was a tortuous, abnormal vessel located adjacent to the main pulmonary artery (MPA) emptying into the posteromedial aspect of the MPA. There was an accelerated, continuous flow across the stenotic ostium. Moreover, there was severe MR from a restricted posterior leaflet of the mitral valve (MV) associated with ventricular remodeling in combination with mitral annular dilatation.
Coronary angiography with a single RCA injection revealed a markedly dilated RCA providing multiple intercoronary collaterals of various sizes communicating with the left coronary system. The LCA later opacified the MPA through a stenotic ostium, establishing the diagnostic hallmark of ALCAPA syndrome. The calculated ratio of pulmonary-systemic blood flow was 1.4, confirming a significant left-to-right shunt. Coronary computed tomography angiography clearly identified the ALCAPA with a retropulmonary ostium. Volume-rendered image depicted the course of the anomalous coronary arteries and its inter-coronary collateral pathways along the epicardial surface and where the LCA connected to the MPA. Stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging demonstrated no myocardial ischemia, suggesting adequate collateral circulation to the LV.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was diagnosed with ALCAPA syndrome, a congenital heart defect, resulting in a left-to-right shunt, and severe MR. No myocardial ischemia was detected through stress cardiovascular magnetic resonance perfusion imaging. The patient's LV and LCA were dilated while also experiencing mitral annular dilatation. The disease was diagnosed and monitored through various tests and imaging, such as Transthoracic echocardiography, Transesophageal echocardiography, coronary angiography, and coronary computed tomography angiography.

Chief Complaint:
Progressive non-itching hypomelanotic macular lesions

History:
The patient had a previous history of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL) 11 years back, for which he was treated with Cap. Miltefosine. General and systemic examinations revealed no other abnormalities. Both microscopic examination and qPCR of the skin following a positive rK39 test confirmed the presence of LD body and DNA respectively.

Hospital Course:
The patient was prescribed to take Cap. Miltefosine for 84 days. After taking the drug for 33 days, the patient experienced mild pain, increased lacrimation, and redness of the left eye followed by photophobia and marked dimness of vision. He was advised to stop the medicine and was referred to the Department of Ophthalmology. The doctors diagnosed him with Mooren’s ulcer based on visual acuity, matted eyelashes, congested conjunctiva, and 360° peripheral corneal infiltration with ulceration. The patient was treated with topical antibiotics, steroids, and lubricant eye drops. He was eventually treated with multi-dose LAmB without any adverse events, after which his eye condition returned to normal.

Follow Up:
On 6-month follow-up, his skin qPCR for LD-DNA was negative, and there was no ophthalmic complaint.

Diagnosis:
Visceral Leishmaniasis followed by Mooren's ulcer.

Plan of Care:
The patient was treated with Cap. Miltefosine and eventually with multi-dose LAmB. The eye condition was managed with topical antibiotics, steroids, and lubricants as per the ophthalmologists. The patient was advised to take necessary precautions and follow-up as per the doctor's advice.

Summary:
The patient was admitted with the complaints of progressive non-itching hypomelanotic macular lesions. The treatment prescribed for Visceral Leishmaniasis resulted in the development of Mooren's ulcer. The patient was treated with multi-dose LAmB, after which his eye condition returned to normal.

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of chemotherapy for coat cell lymphoma in 2011, splenectomy in 2013 and autologous bone marrow transplantation in 2014.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) due to fever and malaise. Upon admission, she was somnolent with rales over both lungs and tachycardia without heart murmurs. She was suspected of having sepsis with septic shock and pneumonia. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia of 125/min.

Treatment and Diagnostic Procedures:
The patient's shock was managed initially by rapid infusion of crystalloids followed by noradrenalin infusion up-titrated to 66μg/min and other medications to reach normotension. Imipenem 500 mg/6 h IV was administered after collecting hemocultures, urinoculture and aspirates. Continuous ECG monitoring, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure measurements were performed along with central venous, arterial and urine catheters for hemodynamic and fluid management.

Results:
Positive pneumococcal urine antigen confirmed streptococcal pneumonia, and other microbiological cultures remained negative. The patient needed 40% oxygen by mask for satisfactory blood gases and did not need either non-invasive or invasive ventilation during the entire ICU stay. Hemodynamic instability led to the decision to start continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) combined with hemoadsoption treatment by CytoSorb® membrane for the next 24 h, which improved hemodynamic situation. The patient received CVVH intermittently for another 21 days.

Principal Diagnosis: MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1)

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian man, was admitted for bicytopenia in May 2013. His initial blood cell count showed hemoglobin 8 g/dl, platelets 87 × 109/l, and leukocytes 6.1 × 109/L. He had a medical history of T2D treated with biphasic insulin aspart and triple-bypass surgery for coronary disease in 2010. No family history of hematological malignancies was noted. He was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for grade IV anemia and then transferred to the hematology department after blood transfusions. Bone marrow aspiration showed multilineage dysplasia with 8% of blasts, consistent with a diagnosis of MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1).

The patient was initially treated with darbepoetin 300 μg per week, without response. A second bone marrow aspiration two months later showed 29% of blasts, consistent with the diagnosis of AML progression. He consented to participate in a phase I–II clinical research study assessing the combination of 5-azacitidine with idarubicin in July 2013. He showed a partial response with 8% of bone marrow blasts after six cycles, and transfusion independence.

However, the patient reported higher blood glucose levels 2–3 days after the start of each 5-azacitidine cycle, requiring an increased dose of self-administered insulin. Further monitoring confirmed higher blood glucose levels from days 4 to 12 of each 5-azacitidine cycle. No change in diet or in physical activities was noted. Our patient experienced such dysregulation during all the additional 15 cycles until a fatal progression of AML.

Impression:

The patient was admitted with bicytopenia and diagnosed with MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1). After no response to initial treatment, he participated in a clinical research study and experienced a partial response. However, he had blood glucose dysregulation during the treatment cycles.

This 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital presenting with increased appetite, palpitations, weight loss, and heat intolerance. Physical examination revealed the presence of a 4 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. The patient had a known history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

Diagnostic Findings:

The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was suppressed 0.29 uIU/mL, while free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were elevated. A radioiodine uptake scan detected an abnormal focus of hot uptake in the left lobe, which was suggestive of a hyperfunctioning toxic thyroid nodule. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed, and the cytology report indicated thyroid carcinoma. 

Treatment:

The patient underwent total thyroidectomy, and the pathological report confirmed FVPTC findings. The lesion was limited to the solitary tumor, measuring a diameter of 3.5 cm. Ablative radioiodine therapy was not recommended due to the small size of the tumor. Post-surgery, the patient received levothyroxine medication to prevent hypothyroidism and to stop TSH stimulation. 

Follow-Up:

Serum TSH and serum thyroglobulin were regularly monitored. On follow-up visit, radioactive iodine whole-body scan showed no distant metastasis. 

Summary:

This 70-year-old male patient presented classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism which were investigated by FNA revealing FVPTC arising within a toxic nodule.

Chief Complaint: Chest pain radiating to the back with associated nausea

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 79-year-old female, was admitted to [Hospital Name] with a complaint of chest pain radiating to the back with associated nausea. She had a past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (in remission). Initial examination showed afebrility with mild epigastric tenderness and blood pressure 161/78 mm Hg. The patient's laboratory values revealed a white blood cell count of 7.33 K/µL and hemoglobin of 13.3 g/dL.

Abdominal ultrasound revealed a dilated common bile duct (CBD) without stones but with a slightly dilated gallbladder. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed CBD dilation without definite stricture. However, subsequent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a biliary stricture at the hepatic duct bifurcation. A sphincterotomy was performed, biopsies were obtained, and 2 biliary stents were placed. One stent was placed into the right system, and a second stent went into the left system past the stricture into the right and left hepatic ducts and extending distally into the CBD with adequate bile flow. The patient tolerated the procedure well without complications.

After discharge, the patient immediately began to experience nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. On examination, the patient was found to be markedly tender to palpation in the left upper quadrant. Computed tomography scan revealed migration of the stent through the duodenal wall. An upper endoscopy was performed, confirming penetration of the stent through the lateral portion of the second part of the duodenum. The stent was then extracted using a grasping device revealing a transmural defect. This was closed using endoclips.

Hospital Course:

This is a summary of the hospital course for a neonate with several medical conditions and congenital perineal groove. The patient was born via vaginal delivery to a 34-year-old Asian mother who had gestational diabetes. The infant's birth weight was 4910 g, and Apgar scores were 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. Due to dyspnea, the neonate was evaluated further in the NICU where a perineal defect was noted. On examination, a perineal groove was observed that extended vertically downward from the base of the vaginal fourchette to the anterior rim of the anus at the 12 o'clock position. The perineal groove was a moist red sulcus that was about 1 cm long, 0.1 cm wide and 0.1 cm deep.

The neonate had multiple medical conditions, including asphyxia neonatorum, neonatal wet lung disease, fetal macrosomia, cephalohematoma of newborn, PDA, and myocardial injury that were managed while inpatient. During admission, the neonate had normal excretory functions and vital signs. The patient was diagnosed with congenital perineal groove and as a neonate of a diabetic mother based on clinical examination. 

After further examinations, the neonate was discharged home with her parents at 9 days of life when all her conditions improved. The parents in case one and case two were advised to undergo follow-up examinations.

Name: [Redacted]
Gender: Male
Age: 44

Chief Complaint:
Swelling and dull pain in the left mandible

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic with reports of swelling and dull pain in the left mandible. Clinical examination revealed swelling in the left lower molar area and the left mandible. Radiological examination showed a large irregular multilocular radiolucency in the left area of the mandible, extending to the premolar and molar area. A CT image revealed an abnormal mass in the mandible. The initial clinical impression was an ameloblastoma, myxoma, keratocystic odontogenic tumor or another tumor type lesion.

The patient underwent surgery to remove the mass and the buccal cortical bone that was in contact with the mass. The mass was fully excised, and the inferior alveolar nerve in contact with the mass was preserved.

Microscopically, the tumor tissues were composed of plexiform or cord-like nests of tumor cells with round to oval nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm in a matrix with prominent myxoid change. The primary tumor was diagnosed as a glomus tumor based on these findings. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for vimentin, muscle-specific actin/HHF35, Calponin, and a hairline-shaped area of positive staining for type IV collagen surrounding the tumor cells. The patient remained symptom-free with no signs of recurrence.

During an 8-year follow-up, a recurrent tumor was detected in a panoramic radiograph. After CT and MRI exams, the recurrent tumor mass and related teeth were removed under general anesthesia. The patient has no symptoms of recurrence as of this writing, 2 years after the second operation and will be followed for the long term to promptly detect any signs of new tumor growth.

Conclusion:
The patient presented with swelling and dull pain in the left mandible. After the initial clinical evaluation and imaging studies, a glomus tumor was diagnosed, and surgical excision was performed. The patient presented with a recurrent mass 8 years after the primary surgery, and the mass was also surgically removed. Follow-up showed no signs of recurrence to date.",1,0,0

Admission Date: January 2016
Discharge Date: N/A

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 9-year-old female with no medical history, presented with low back and left lower limb pain in January 2016. She was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left tibia with a solitary metastasis in her L3 vertebrae in February 2016. She subsequently underwent a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation from L1 to L5 with decompression laminectomy at L2-3, and L3-4 through a posterior and left thoracoabdominal approach in March 2016. The patient was found to have an abnormal bone scan with a lesion at the L3 level 3 months after completing chemotherapy in November 2016. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of right paraspinal psoas tissue, the patient was confirmed to have recurrent osteoblastic osteosarcoma in December 2016.

Physical Examination:

On physical examination, the patient was able to ambulate with use of a below knee prosthesis and demonstrated no neurological deficits.

Treatment:

The patient was started on second line drugs, including two cycles of ifosfamide/etoposide. Previous implants were well in place. Imaging was performed with radiographs, CT scan, bone scan, PET scan, and MRI scan with contrast enhancement to confirm only a single metastatic site. The option of nonoperative palliative care was offered to the patient and her family, but they elected to proceed with en bloc resection to maximize her chances of survival, in spite of high surgical risk and an overall poor prognosis. They were informed preoperatively that a complete resection would require sacrificing her nerve roots at L2, L3 and L4. A palliative decompression was not offered for the revision procedure as a treatment option as the patient was not complaining of pain or neurological symptoms, and it would not have improved her life expectancy. 

Conclusion:

In summary, the patient is a 9-year-old female with no previous medical history who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left tibia with a solitary metastasis in her L3 vertebrae. Despite undergoing a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation, the patient was confirmed to have a recurrence of osteoblastic osteosarcoma. The patient was started on second line drugs and subsequently had en bloc resection of L2, L3, and L4.

Age: 73 years
Final Diagnosis: Small invasive appendiceal adenocarcinoma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to intermittent right-sided abdominal pain and a right-sided abdominal bulge. She had a history of atrial fibrillation and mitral valve prolapse. She visited the emergency department twice before, in 2013 and 2015, for the same symptoms but the evaluations were negative. Her colonoscopy in 2016 and CT scan of the abdomen were also normal. However, the symptoms recurred in 2017 and a CT scan revealed colon interposed between the liver and the abdominal wall along with some mild periappendiceal stranding. Because of the long duration of the symptoms and radiologic findings, it was decided that surgical intervention was necessary. The patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic right colectomy. It was noted during initial laparoscopic exploration that the colon was no longer interposed above the liver. A very redundant proximal transverse colon was found which could easily be maneuvered into the configuration noted on her CT scan. She was discharged on postoperative day 3 with no complications and without any significant findings.

Brief Hospitalization Summary:
The patient had intermittent right-sided abdominal pain and a right-sided abdominal bulge which had been recurrent over the last 10 years. She visited the emergency department twice before, in 2013 and 2015, for the same symptoms but the evaluations were negative. A colonoscopy in 2016 and CT scan of the abdomen were also normal. However, in 2017, a CT scan revealed colon interposed between the liver and the abdominal wall along with some mild periappendiceal stranding. The patient underwent an uneventful laparoscopic right colectomy. She was discharged on postoperative day 3 with no complications and without any significant findings. The final pathology revealed a small invasive appendiceal adenocarcinoma arising in the background of goblet cell carcinoid with negative lymph nodes and negative margins staged as T3N0.

The patient had a T2-weighted MRI and lateral knee radiograph at 11-month follow-up that confirmed patella alta deformity, an intact albeit lax patellar tendon, and cartilage fissuring near the inferior patellar apex. His preoperative patient-reported outcome scores were reported.

Hospital Course and Procedures:
The previous midline incision was dissected to visualize and confirm obvious redundancy and thinning of the patellar tendon. A rectangular block of redundant patellar tendon tissue was outlined and resected to correct the degree of patella alta. The patella was mobilized using blunt dissection. The suture material from the index repair was removed, and the distal patellar footprint was prepared. Two anchors were anchored 2 cm apart on the distal patellar footprint. Krackow sutures were passed through the midsubstance of the patellar tendon, and with the opposite limb of each stitch, a half hitch was made such that a pulley mechanism was created. The tendon was reapproximated, and final fixation was secured with four mattress anchor knots with five alternating half hitches. The wound was closed with a standard layered closure. Postoperative lateral knee radiograph displayed that patella alta had been corrected. At 18-month follow-up, the patient had a repeat MRI performed which demonstrated that patella alta had been corrected.

Health Maintenance:
The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and regular exercise. No specific medications or treatments were advised or prescribed.

Follow-Up:
The patient reported moderate functional limitations and had permanent work-duty restrictions. Patient reported outcomes did not permit return to his full occupational capacity. The patient was advised to follow up with their primary care physician for any additional care needed.",,,0

Discharge date: 19/07/2017

Primary Diagnosis: Necrotizing fasciitis

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 40-year-old Caucasian male with a medical history free of any particular disease. The patient presented with two self-inflicted wounds on his left arm due to the mishandling of work tools. The patient had a history of smoking six packs per year and occasional drinking. Upon examination, the patient showed signs of redness, swelling, and fever accompanied by edema in his left upper arm. The patient received antibiotic treatment but came back with persistent pain and interruption in his left arm function. Upon admission, the patient was immediately given an orthopedic evaluation that led to a fasciotomy procedure being performed. Blood cultures obtained before initiating antibiotic therapy, a separate set for aerobes and anaerobes, showed positive results. After conducting additional diagnostic investigations, the Infectious Disease service concluded that the patient had Necrotizing Fasciitis. The team began a broad-spectrum empirical antibiotic therapy with metronidazole, piperacillin/tazobactam, and doxycycline.

Multiple swabs and tissue samples were gathered and sent to the laboratory for testing. The samples showed the presence of two anaerobic pansensitive bacteria, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Atopobium parvulum. The isolates were responsive to piperacillin/tazobactam. Despite using an appropriate antibiotic course and advanced medication and vacuum-assisted closure therapy, a large area of coagulation and necrosis remained. A second debridement was performed, and the VAC treatment was continued. Subsequently, the patient began to form granulation tissue. The patient's therapy was changed to oral Amoxicillin/Clavulanate to continue outside the hospital. The patient underwent plastic surgery to cover a skin graft and showed reduced symptoms and significant improvement three months after surgery.

During his hospital stay, the patient received adequate support and care from all members of the medical team, with constant monitoring of his vital signs. He has now been discharged in stable condition, advised to follow up regularly to ensure his recovery progresses as planned.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Recurrent plasmacytoma arising from the anterior elements of C1 and C2 vertebrae

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with complaints of dysarthria and was diagnosed with a recurrent plasmacytoma arising from the anterior elements of the C1 and C2 vertebrae. The patient had a history of a similar tumor 16 years ago, which was diagnosed as plasmacytoma at that time. The patient underwent cervical spine fusion and mass reduction surgery, followed by additional radiotherapy. However, the patient dropped out from the treatment course.

During the current admission, the patient underwent excisional biopsy of the tumor, which revealed diffuse proliferation of plasmacytoid tumor cells with pale paranuclear area and dense chromatin. The tumor cells showed dual expression of kappa and lambda light chains. Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of plasmacytes showing dual expression or deviation of kappa and lambda light chain. CT and MRI revealed no skeletal abnormality except for the primary lesion, and absence of end-organ damage attributable to proliferative plasma cell disorder.

After diagnosis, the patient underwent nine courses of VRD therapy, which reduced the size of the lesion. The patient's condition improved, and two years after diagnosis, the lesions have not increased in size. Bone marrow examinations have shown no progression to plasma cell myeloma.

- Dental amalgam fillings 15 years ago
- No significant history of medical conditions

Chief Complaint:
- Pain in the gum behind the lower second molar

Hospital Course Summary:

Upon examination, the patient was found to have a supra-erupted upper third molar that was causing abnormal contact with the lower gum, resulting in pain. Radiographic examination confirmed the clinical findings. The oral examination also revealed generalized erosion on the facial, cervical, incisal, and occlusal surfaces of the teeth. Heat and cold sensitivity tests revealed normal results. The patient's medical history did not reveal any usual suspected causes of erosion.

The patient was asked to record a diet log for 1 week until the next appointment to determine the extrinsic source of erosion. Salivary tests were also carried out, which revealed normal salivary flow with a decrease in salivary pH and buffering capacity. On examining the diet log at the next appointment, the only dietary agent that was consistently consumed by the patient that had the potential to cause such erosion was Granny Smith apples.

The patient was advised to reduce his consumption of Granny Smith apples and to implement better oral hygiene practices. The patient was discharged with instructions to return for a follow-up appointment in 3 months.",,,0
2381,"Discharge Summary:

Patient was a 13-year-old female who presented with a recurrent abdominal pain and bloody stool. Imaging study revealed a mass that included fecalith occupying her pelvic and right lower abdominal cavity. The patient underwent drainage of the abscess and appendectomy, which revealed primary adenocarcinoma of the appendix (PAA) in the tip of the resected appendix. A radical operation was then performed for the residual tumor of PAA in the pelvic cavity.

The patient received the whole mass resection, ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection, and subsequent sigmoid colostomy. Postoperative pathological examination demonstrated negative margins and no lymph node invasions, and final pathological stage was pT4(SI)N0M0, stage II (TNM-7th edition 2009). Postoperative course was uneventful.

After the operation, the patient received 6 cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), leucovorin (LV), and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) chemotherapy and received subsequent 6 cycles of simplified LV and 5-FU (sLV5FU2) chemotherapy. The patient is doing well till today on follow-up without progression of the disease 5 years after the operation. The patient underwent stoma closure operation 2 years after the tumor resection.

PAA is an extremely rare disease, and there is no consensus for the goal of the operation for PAA in children. Generally, functional preservation operation has often been emphasized in pediatric surgery. In this case, the patient underwent a radical operation and adjuvant chemotherapy, which led to a good postoperative course without progression of the disease after 5 years. The patient's experience may provide new insights into the guideline of the standard treatment for PAA in children.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The 9-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to repeated loss of consciousness, concomitant with a pale face, palpitations, and convulsions. The symptoms had persisted for 2 years and had been aggravated during the previous 2 months. The patient was previously misdiagnosed with epilepsy in another hospital, but no abnormal findings were detected on a 24-h electroencephalogram at our hospital. Her abdominal perfusion CT showed a highly perfused nodule within the pancreatic tail, while a magnetic resonance scan confirmed the location of this nodule. Additionally, 68Ga-exendin 4 PET-CT showed a region in the pancreatic tail with abnormally high metabolism and overexpression of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor. Lab testing showed low fasting blood glucose, a high proinsulin level, a normal C-peptide level, a serum insulin level, and a gastrin level. These results confirmed a diagnosis of insulinoma. A minimally invasive insulinoma enucleation surgery under the Da Vinci robot-assisted system with intraoperative ultrasound was performed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. Pathological examination showed that the tumor was a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor with a Ki-67 index of 4%. This tumor was positive for CgA, Syn, and AE1/AE3, while gastrin, glucagon, and somatostatin staining were negative.

Patient: 42 year-old female

Chief Complaint: Subgingivally fractured permanent maxillary left central incisor

Hospital Course:

The patient was referred to the Master of Endodontics of the University of Santiago de Compostela with a subgingivally fractured permanent maxillary left central incisor as a result of a domestic accident. A thorough clinical examination showed a heavily restored maxillary left central incisor that was tender to palpation. Radiographic examinations revealed an oblique crown-root fracture that extended approximately one-third of the root length. Further radiographic findings showed periapical radiolucencies in the adjacent upper left lateral incisor and canine, both teeth remaining negative to cold testing. The diagnosis was a globulomaxillary cyst, and both teeth were root canal treated and the cyst enucleated. Orthodontic extrusion of the fractured permanent maxillary central incisor was performed to move the vestibular fracture line approximately 6mm above the alveolar crest. Brackets were attached from upper right first premolar to upper left first premolar and an extrusion of approximately 6mm was obtained within 6 months. The root canal retreatment was performed and a fiber post was placed using a dual-cure cement. The tooth was prepared for a crown and a temporary crown was placed until the ceramic crown was created. An external full mouth tooth whitening was performed before determining the shade of the permanent crown, which was subsequently seated to the prepared tooth. The upper right central incisor was restored using composite and good aesthetics were achieved.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient is a 65-year-old female who presented to the tertiary eye centre with symptoms of painless right eye vision distortion that had been ongoing for six weeks. She reported no history of eye injury or trauma. On examination, the patient's VA was found to be 6/24 in the right eye and 6/5 in the left eye. Following slit-lamp biomicroscopy and fundoscopy, the patient was diagnosed with a right eye full-thickness macular hole, a left eye epiretinal membrane, and posterior vitreous detachment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient underwent right eye pars plana vitrectomy, internal limiting membrane peeling and cryotherapy with C3F8 12% gas tamponade. The procedure was successful, and the patient's VA had improved to 6/18 with no complications. Unfortunately, seven weeks postoperatively, the patient developed right eye macula-on RD due to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in the inferior retina. RD repair was performed, with a silicone oil (Densiron 68) tamponade and retinectomy to release the PVR. After four months, the patient's VA returned to 6/12 with a flat retina and closed macular hole. However, four months later, the patient's VA declined to 6/36 in the right eye. A fundus fluorescein angiogram confirmed severe CMO in the right eye, for which the patient underwent right eye posterior sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone injection and was started on ketorolac trometamol eye drops (Acular) three times a day and oral acetazolamide 250 mg slow-release twice a day.

TREATMENT INITIATED:
The patient received three posterior sub-Tenon’s triamcinolone injections and two intravitreal triamcinolone injections within 14 months, with no complications. Though the CMO initially responded to each triamcinolone injection, it later recurred. The patient then received four intravitreal dexamethasone 0.7-mg implants (Ozurdex; Allergan, Inc.) uneventfully. While the implants maintained a dry fovea for a longer period, the CMO recurred again. A trial of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (Avastin) was not helpful.

DISCHARGE INFORMATION:
After two years without any successful treatments, the patient decided to receive ILUVIEN intravitreal implant. In the first week, the patient developed mild right eye anterior uveitis with an initial IOP of 27 mmHg in the right eye and 18 mmHg in the left eye, which was successfully managed with dexamethasone drops and latanoprost drops. At the time of this report, it is 20 months since receiving the ILUVIEN implant, and the patient still has a dry fovea with right eye VA at 6/18.

FOLLOW-UP CAREUPON DISCHARGE:
The patient has been advised to attend regular follow-up appointments with her ophthalmologist to monitor her right eye full-thickness macular hole, left eye epiretinal membrane, and posterior vitreous detachment. The patient has been informed about the risks and benefits of any further interventions and is aware that additional treatments may be necessary to manage her condition successfully. The patient has also been advised to report any concerning symptoms promptly. The recommended follow-up interval is three months.",,,0

The patient has a history of gout and had been on allopurinol, prednisolone, and alendronate for the last 14 months. Imaging confirmed extensive abscess formation that had spread from the zygomatic arch to the level of C4/C5. Bone resorption and fracture of the mandible were also observed, along with compression of the internal jugular vein and enlarged lymphatic glands of the left side of the neck.

Hospital Course:

On admission, the patient had subjective symptoms of trismus, moderate pain, and the feeling of impending rupture. Objective examination revealed a large swelling on the left side of the face with pus from the extraction sockets of the lower left first and second molars. Despite medical advice, the patient refused admission for treatment with intravenous antibiotics and drainage but accepted a prescription for oral antibiotics to use at home. One month later, he presented to his general dentist with persistent infection and worsening of the swelling and was immediately admitted to the hospital for further management. The patient underwent venous phase contrast-enhanced CT imaging, which confirmed the extent of the infection and bone destruction.

Treatment:

The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical intervention for drainage of the abscess. The patient was also advised to continue oral antibiotics and received adequate analgesics. The treatment was successful, and the patient was discharged with instructions to complete the course of oral antibiotics and attend regular follow-up appointments with his general dentist and the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery. 

Summary:

The patient presented with a severe mandibular infection that had worsened over the past month. Imaging confirmed extensive abscess formation, bone resorption, and fracture of the mandible. The patient was treated with intravenous antibiotics and underwent surgical intervention for drainage of the abscess.

Admitting Diagnosis: Erosive soft tissue mass lesion

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with swelling over the root of the nose. The swelling was broadened by an ill-defined 2.5x2.0 cm swelling, which gradually increased in size. The patient had recurrent episodes in which the swelling increased in size. On examination, the swelling was soft and non-tender with a normal temperature. Anterior rhinoscopy revealed no abnormality.

A blood analysis showed raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 38mm. The patient had a positive Monteux test, and a chest X-ray showed no abnormality. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the nose revealed an enhancing soft tissue mass lesion in the superior aspect of both nasal cavities, measuring 2.0x1.8x2.8 cm (AP x TR x CC), eroding the intervening nasal septum, frontal and nasal bones at the glabella and reaching the subcutaneous tissue. The base of the skull was eroded with a small intracranial extension.

The patient underwent endoscopic examination and biopsy under general anesthesia. Histopathology showed lesional tissue focally lined pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium with subepithelial epithelioid cell granuloma admixed with Langhans giant cells, suggestive of tuberculosis.

Treatment:
The patient was started on category I anti-tubercular treatment (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol) for the first 2 months followed by isoniazid and rifampicin for the next 4 months.

Patient Name: N/A
Date of Admission: N/A
Date of Discharge: N/A

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 53-year-old man, presented to our Department with a 2-month history of a painful and moderately swollen left wrist. Standard anteroposterior and lateral X-rays of his left wrist revealed two osteolytic lesions involving the distal ulna and the lunate fossa of the distal radius without any joint involvement. Subsequent biopsy of his left ulna under regional anesthesia produced brown spongy material, histologically characterized by the presence of large numbers of multinucleated giant cells and spindle cells in a dense collagenous background. These findings were histologically consistent with a diagnosis of Giant Cell Tumor (GCT) and correlation with the clinical and radiological findings was recommended by the pathologist. As he had no other skeletal manifestations, a complete resection of the distal ulna followed, along with curettage and cementoplasty of the distal radial metaphysis, to support the articular surface.

Two weeks postoperatively, he was re-admitted to our orthopedic department with diffuse musculoskeletal soreness, anorexia, constipation, nausea, and localized abdominal pain. He also reported weight loss of approximately 5 kg. On palpation, he had tenderness in the thoracic wall, the second and fifth metacarpals of his right hand, the left tibia, the pelvic ring, and the left shoulder girdle and humerus. Plain radiographs revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in his ribs, right hand, left tibia, and scapula. A histopathological examination of both the resected ulna and the curettings of the radius revealed similar findings: numerous, multinucleated, osteoclast-type giant cells were noted amid a mononuclear, spindle cell, histiocytoid component. Based on the similar findings of both lesions and the rarity of multifocal GCT of bone, the histopathology report included in the differential diagnosis a Bone Tumor of hyperparathyroidism, either primary or in the setting of a paraneoplastic PTH-like protein production and suggested further patient evaluation.

Our patient’s laboratory examination showed high total serum calcium, low serum phosphorus, and low 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Primary Hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) was suspected and confirmed by the elevated PTH levels. Serum potassium and sodium concentrations and thyroid hormone levels were in reference range, as well as the main cancer indicators. His human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was elevated. An isotope bone scan showed multiple sites of uptake over his ribs bilaterally, the lower pole of both scapulae, multiple foci in his pelvis, the metacarpal bones of his right hand, and his right tibia. At subsequent radiological work-up, both computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography of his neck revealed a mass emanating from the right lobe of his thyroid gland. Parathyroid subtraction technetium-99m (99mTc) sestamibi (MIBI) scintigraphy showed extensive uptake in his right lower parathyroid gland. Multiple endocrine neoplasia was excluded because of the normal MRI imaging of his pituitary gland.

Appropriate medical care was given to our patient including hyperhydration and high doses of diuretics and diphosphonates. After his health status improved and his serum calcium nearly normalized, a specialist surgeon was consulted for further surgical treatment. Surgery consisted of extensive resection: total thyroidectomy with removal of the parathyroid glands. A mass abutting the thyroid gland was documented at surgery. The mass was surrounded by a thick capsule, had a tan-brown, solid, and microcystic cut surface, and rubbery consistency. On histologic examination, the tumor comprised small cells with minimal to scanty cytoplasm and round nuclei, arranged in an organoid pattern, with frequent perivascular pseudorosettes. Thick fibrous septa emanating from the capsule were noted within the tumor. There was capsular invasion, with extension of neoplastic groups in the surrounding loose connective tissue adjacent to striated muscle, and foci of vascular invasion in the tumor capsule. The histologic findings were consistent with a parathyroid carcinoma. The neoplasm did not appear to invade the adjacent thyroid lobe and did not involve the margins of resection.

The patient experienced postoperatively persistent hypocalcemia requiring calcium and vitamin D replacement. His condition was characterized as “hungry bone syndrome.” He is now recovering 12 months after surgery, with a serum PTH level of 7.1 pg/mL and serum calcium level of 10.7 mg/dl and he is under calcium and vitamin D replacement therapy. The lytic bone lesions have almost disappeared, and no other additional orthopedic intervention is necessary. He is closely followed by general surgeons, oncologists, and endocrinologists.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient, a 76-year-old male with a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, was admitted to our hospital in 2013 with a diagnosis of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (AE with IPF). Treatment enrolled steroid pulse, followed by systemic corticosteroid and cyclosporine therapy. Thereafter, his respiratory condition gradually improved, and he was discharged with oxygen therapy of 2 L/min via a nasal cannula.

During his follow-up, he exhibited an 8% decline in his forced vital capacity (FVC) after the remission of AE, which raised concerns of pulmonary function impairment. An increase in his FVC decline led to initiating nintedanib (300 mg/day) in December 2015, a medication approved by the FDA for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, moderate deterioration of liver function after five months of nintedanib therapy resulted in the discontinuation of the medication. The patient reported right lower abdominal pain in September 2016 and was diagnosed with acute gangrenous appendicitis.

While there was no deterioration of pulmonary function, a new nodular lesion in the right lower lobe of the lung measured 13.5 mm × 11.7 mm during the course of nintedanib therapy. After the discontinuation of nintedanib therapy in January 2017, the size of the nodular lesion increased from 10.7 mm × 12.5 mm to 20.8 mm × 22.0 mm. A surgical resection of the nodule was performed, which confirmed the diagnosis as squamous cell carcinoma.

In light of the patient's condition, he was discharged with instructions for further follow-up evaluation and pertinent appointments.

Patient Identification:
The patient is a 21-year-old male with a medical and dental history of left hemimaxillectomy, adenoidectomy, and partial removal of zygoma due to rhabdomyosarcoma of the left maxillary sinus. He also underwent a FRF of iliac crest, radiotherapy and chemotherapy before and after the surgical intervention. He presented to our outpatient clinic with a complaint of painless swelling in the upper left posterior region.

Hospital Course:
The patient was examined, and an oral examination revealed an exophytic, irregular, pedunculated lesion with elastic consistency in the left maxillary region, associated with the buccal flange and the fitting surface of the upper removable partial denture (RPD). Radiographic investigation did not show any bone resorption at the site of the lesion. A cold-blade incisional biopsy was performed, and dysplasia was ruled out. A decision was made not to wear the RPD for two weeks, and routine blood tests were carried out. A benign lesion with vascular structures and diffuse inflammatory infiltrate of granulocytes and neutrophils, with focal aspects of abscess formation, was revealed upon histological examination after the excision of the lesion by CO2 laser under local anesthesia.

Further Action Taken:
After a three-week follow-up, deepening of the buccal vestibule by CO2 laser was performed to facilitate better stability of the RPD remake, responding to a request from the prosthodontic department.

Summary:
The patient presented with a painless swelling in the left maxillary region associated with the fitting surface of the RPD. The lesion was excised by CO2 laser under local anesthesia, and a biopsy was performed, which ruled out dysplasia. The histological examination revealed a benign lesion with vascular structures and diffuse inflammatory infiltrate of granulocytes and neutrophils, with focal aspects of abscess formation. Further follow-up revealed the necessity for deepening of the buccal vestibule by CO2 laser to facilitate better stability of the RPD remake.",,,1
728,"Hospital Course:
The patient is an 84-year old male with chronic hepatitis C and liver cirrhosis who was referred to our outpatient clinic for the evaluation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The patient had previously undergone transarterial chemoembolization and radiofrequency ablation for HCC and had a wedge resection of two nodules in hepatic segments VI and VII in December 2008. Histological examination confirmed HCC grade III with necrosis and microscopic vascular thrombosis.

In September 2009, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed millimetric disease relapse in hepatic segments V, II, III, and I, as well as a 21 × 9 mm adenopathy at the hepatic hilum. A new resection was scheduled but was not carried out due to the detection of a right portal branch neoplastic thrombosis during intra-operative ultrasound.

In January 2010, the patient began systemic treatment with metronomic capecitabine according to a previously described protocol. The therapy was well tolerated, and after 1 month, serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) decreased to 643 ng/mL. After 3 months, serum AFP had drastically decreased to 7 ng/mL, and a marked reduction in liver lesion size was observed by MRI, evaluated as a partial response according to Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST).

In August 2010, computer tomography (CT) scanning showed a single hypodense lesion of 13 mm in hepatic segment II without any other liver lesions. Given the presence of a single lesion, the possibility of residual disease ablation was explored using hepatic contrast-enhanced ultrasound. Two suspicious lesions for HCC were detected in hepatic segments II and III, and the lesions were submitted to needle biopsy. Histological analysis identified a nodule of low-grade dysplasia in segment II and micro and macronodular cirrhosis with light activity in segment III.

The patient underwent metronomic capecitabine until July 2013, when the sustained complete response was confirmed, and the treatment was discontinued, and the patient entered a follow-up program. The final MRI (February 2017) confirmed the complete response. To date, the patient is alive and in good health.",,,0

The patient was on various medications, including antihypertensive drugs, antipsychotics, thyroid hormone, vitamin D supplements, bicarbonate and calcium supplements, potassium, phosphate binders, and darbopoietin.

Diagnostic Workup:
A biochemical control revealed a relevant increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, which was likely caused by interference from the patient's sevelamer dosage. The patient's levothyroxine dose was already high for her body weight, and a reduction in absorption should have been suspected. The TSH levels returned to normal once the sevelamer dosage was discontinued, and timing of levothyroxine treatment was modified.

Hospital Course:
The patient's fatigue improved after the interference was discontinued, and the patient was discharged from the hospital in a stable condition with instructions to continue monitoring her medication interactions.

Final Diagnosis:
The patient experienced severe fatigue due to drug interference caused by sevelamer dosage.

Discharge Condition:
Stable condition.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient was advised to follow up with her primary care physician to reassess her medication regimen and to continue monitoring potential drug interactions.

Reason for Admission:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for breast reconstruction due to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) in the right breast.

Hospital Course:

The patient underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy (NSM), sentinel node biopsy (SNB) and breast reconstruction with a de-epithelialized DIEP flap using thoracodorsal vessels as recipient vessels. Postoperative hormone therapy was continued at a nearby medical facility. At an outpatient visit three years and eight months after surgery, a tumor measuring 5mm was detected by palpation at the lower right region of the right breast and a tumor shadow was identified on ultrasound. Further treatment was necessary due to multiple cancer recurrences in the reconstructed breast. Therefore, extensive extirpation of the nipple-areola, breast skin, and initial breast reconstruction with an anatomical tissue expander (TE) were performed at another hospital. Postoperative adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen and leuprorelin was given.

At one year and eight months after insertion of the TE, breast reconstruction with a right S-GAP flap using internal thoracic vessels as anastomotic vessels was performed. The patient did not experience recurrence at two years and five months (four years after the surgery for the recurrence) postoperatively. Areola and nipple reconstruction were performed through transplantation of a part of the contralateral nipple and use of a full-thickness skin graft from the proximal thigh.

Follow-up Care:

The patient has been monitored for four years and currently continues to be seen every three months on an outpatient basis, each time receiving adjuvant therapy with leuprorelin and anastrozole. The right reconstructed breast appears both upper pole fullness and lower pole skin shortage, but the patient does not desire further surgery.

Admitting Diagnosis: Enlarged extraocular muscles

Final Diagnosis: IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD)

Hospital Course:

The patient was referred from an outside hospital for further evaluation of enlarged extraocular muscles which were incidentally found on CT during evaluation of sinusitis. Upon examination, the patient was noted to have 4 Δ of exotropia (XT) and 3 Δ of right hypertropia (RHT) in the primary position, with intermittent diplopia observed. Orbit MRI showed enlarged muscles, including the left lacrimal gland, right medial rectus, right inferior rectus, right lateral rectus, and right inferior oblique. The patient’s serum IgG4 level was elevated and demonstrated increased positive IgG4 cells on biopsy (>50-70 cells/HPF), indicating a diagnosis of IgG4-ROD. 

The patient was treated with oral steroids and demonstrated improvement in symptoms.  

Physical Exam Findings:

On examination, the patient’s corrected visual acuities were 20/30 OD and OS. Automatic refraction showed +0.00 Dsph − 0.25 Dcyl x 110A OD and +0.25 Dsph − 1.00 Dcyl x 75A OS. The patient showed 4 Δ of exotropia (XT) and 3 Δ of right hypertropia (RHT) in the primary position, as well as with head tilt. Ductions and versions were full, and MRD were +2 mm OU. Exophthalmometry showed 18 mm OD and 16.5 mm OS. 

Laboratory and Imaging Results:

Orbit MR imaging showed enlargement of the left lacrimal gland, right medial rectus, right inferior rectus, right lateral rectus, and right inferior oblique. Serum IgG4 level was elevated to 429.0 mg/dL (normal range, 6.1~ 121.4). Anterior orbitotomy and lacrimal gland biopsy showed increased positive IgG4 cells (>50–70 cells/HPF), and focally positive CD3, CD20, and Ki-67 (6%).

The patient was admitted for ophthalmic assessment due to bilateral blurring of vision. At the time of admission, the patient complained of visual acuity of 1/60 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye. Relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD) was present in the right eye. Grade 1 vitritis was noted in the same eye, with intense retinitis and focal areas of haemorrhage. There was mild pallor of the left optic disc with macula and peripheral granular retinitis. Based on typical fundus features and history of treated CMV colitis, the patient was diagnosed with bilateral eye CMV retinitis.

The patient was diagnosed with combined T and B cell deficiencies by an immunologist at the age of 11. At that time, she presented with recurrent episodes of high fever, diarrhoea, oral thrush, and failure to thrive. The patient received treatment for CMV colitis, including a six-week course of intravenous ganciclovir, three months prior to presentation of her ophthalmic symptoms. Following assessment, the patient was planned for right eye intravitreal ganciclovir injection to address poor visual function with posterior pole involvement.

However, the patient was deemed unfit to undergo general anaesthesia for the injection due to concomitant hospital acquired pneumonia. Instead, the patient was treated with IV ganciclovir 75mg (6mg/kg) 12 hourly. Good response was noted after two weeks of therapy and treatment was continued for eight weeks until the retinitis lesions had healed with scarring. The patient's right visual acuity reduced to light perception and improved to 6/9 in the left eye.

Gender: Male
Age: 73 years
Hospital: St. Marina University Hospital, Varna, Bulgaria
Admission Date: [Date]
Discharge Date: [Date]

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was referred for an autopsy at the Department of Clinical Pathology from the Intensive Respiratory Unit. The underlying reason for hospital admission was an exacerbation of a habitually reported breathlessness. Upon radiological investigation, six formations were found to be present in the lung. The patient had a history of severe smoking habit. The patient had multiple hospitalizations in the past; however, he denied biopsy and, therefore, underwent no treatment. Four days after the hospital admission, the patient died, and he was referred for an autopsy to establish the tanatogenetic cause and mechanisms. 

MEDICAL HISTORY:

The patient was cachexic and had a history of heavy cigarette smoking. The patient had multiple hospitalizations in other hospitals in the past, however, no biopsy was performed, and therefore he underwent no treatment.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was cachexic and was in a rapidly deteriorating condition. Thoracic dissection revealed a total of six well-rounded tumor formations in the lungs, five of which were solid and one was soft and slimy in appearance. The largest tumor formation measured 8 cm in diameter, and the smallest one measured 2 cm in diameter. There was pleural effusion on each thoracic side measuring 200 ml of serous fluid. Abdominal section revealed a solid sub-capsular tumor formation in the liver measuring 2.5 cm in diameter. A section of the large intestine revealed multiple polyps, more than 20 in the cecum alone, two of which were with infiltrative growth into the intestinal wall. The total number of polyps, however, was less than 100. A section of the cranium revealed a well-demarcated formation, which was 1.8 cm in diameter in the precentral gyrus of the right hemisphere, with well-visible margins from the surrounding brain parenchyma.

DIAGNOSIS:

Based on the histological profile of all the lesions, the diagnosis of attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) was accepted.

Admitting Diagnosis: Elevated PSA

Discharge Diagnosis: Granulomatous prostatitis

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a rising PSA level and a negative prostate biopsy one year ago. He was diagnosed with pT1G3 bladder carcinoma and was currently being treated with Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) instillations. The multiparametric magnetic resonance (mpMRI) revealed a suspicious lesion in the right posteromedial peripheral zone at the midgland level with a PI-RADS v2 score of 4 for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

A systematic 42-core, sector-guided transperineal prostate biopsy, with additional cognitive targeted biopsy of the suspicious lesion was performed. Histological findings showed typical features of granulomatous prostatitis (GP) with epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and infiltration of lymphocytes.

GP is often asymptomatic with elevated PSA levels. The MRI characteristics of infective GP caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis or after intravesical BCG instillations have not been extensively described. However, recent studies demonstrate that GP lesions can be differentiated from aggressive prostate cancer due to their chronic pattern, low mean ADC value, decreased signal on the ADC map images, and isointense or decreased signal on high-b-value imaging. GP lesions can mimic aggressive prostate cancer; hence differentiation using the intralesional ADC values is crucial.

The patient's GP was treated appropriately, and he was discharged in stable condition.

Summary:

The patient presented with elevated PSA, and a biopsy showed granulomatous prostatitis. This diagnosis was confirmed through mpMRI, and additional testing was performed. The patient's condition was appropriately managed and treated, leading to a stable discharge.",,,0

The patient presented to our clinic with fluctuating diplopia that gradually developed for 8 months prior to presentation. The patient complained about binocular vision in primary gaze position, in vertical and right lateral gaze directions. The patient had a history of breast cancer, smoldering multiple myeloma, bilateral cataract, and osteoporosis.

Hospital Course:
The patient was evaluated as an outpatient where neurological examination showed right lateral rectus palsy causing an esotropia, moderate not fatigable ptosis and slight adduction deficit in the left eye. The orthoptic measurements revealed an abduction deficit in the right eye, a slight adduction deficit in the left eye, and a bilateral elevation deficit, greater in the left eye. A screening for myasthenia gravis was undertaken which returned negative results. 
The patient was admitted to our department due to a clinical history of fluctuating symptoms. A brain MRI was undertaken which demonstrated large bilateral CCAs, with a larger multilobulated aneurysmal sac on the right. A CT angiography of brain vessels confirmed the presence of bilateral large CCAs. Because of high procedural risk in an elderly frail patient, the patient was treated empirically with oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/day followed by a slow tapering over the course of 2 months.
MR and CT angiographies performed 4 months later showed no change in the bilateral CCAs compared to previous scans. However, there was a severe evolution of the neurological involvement which led the patient to undergo endovascular embolization of the left carotid aneurysm with flow diversion. The patient was treated with dual antiplatelet therapy for 1 month, followed by single antiplatelet drug for other 3 months. At discharge, ptosis in the left eye improved, but complete palsy of oculomotor muscles was still present.

Admission Diagnosis:

Lung metastasis from hepatocellular carcinoma in the upper lobe of the left lung

Hospital Course:

The patient received radiotherapy to the lung metastasis according to the method described hereinafter. Planning CT images were acquired under deep inspiration breath-hold condition with a commercial gold coil marker, Visicoil 21G slim line (IBA Dosimetry, Schwarzenbruck, Germany) of diameter 0.5mm and length 10mm, implanted using CT guidance as close as possible to a tumor. A single-arc coplanar VMAT plan (gantry rotation from 320° to 100°) was created with an isotropic planning target volume (PTV) margin of 5mm and a prescribed dose of 60Gy in 20 fractions. Multiple breath-holds were required to complete the delivery.

During the segmented VMAT beam delivery, the implant marker stayed at the planned breath-hold position, and a DRR image at the gantry start angle was created for each segment. Breath-hold training was given to the patient for optimizing the breath-hold and the following free-breathing periods to successfully complete each segmented breath-hold VMAT delivery.

Subsequently, two lateral lines were manually copied onto a fluoroscopic image window of the XVI display using a transparent sheet. Each line was used as a tolerance limit for the breath-hold beam delivery. During the beam delivery, the breath-hold status was continuously monitored to ensure that the marker position stayed within the tolerance range. If the marker moved outside the tolerance range, beam delivery was interrupted, and the procedure was repeated.

Breath-hold CBCT imaging was performed to confirm that the marker position relative to the tumor remained unchanged. The total VMAT delivery time for a prescribed fraction dose of 3Gy was approximately 115sec, with three beam interrupts and a 25 sec segmented beam delivery followed by 20 sec free breathing.

3093,"Hospital Course Summary:

This is a summary of the hospital course for two patients who presented with different musculoskeletal conditions and received treatment in different periods of time.

Patient 1: Susan
Susan is a 51-year-old woman who presented with symptoms related to scoliosis and carpal tunnel syndrome. She experienced pain and difficulty with daily activities and sought relief through various conventional and alternative therapies without significant benefit. Eventually, she was scheduled for an emergency cervical spine surgery to stabilize her spine and relieve spinal cord compression. The surgery took longer than anticipated and Susan reported complete paralysis on her right side after she woke up from surgery. She was admitted to the hospital for 8 weeks for rehabilitation to learn how to walk again. She continued to experience severe pain and weakness in her arms and hands despite further surgery and various medication treatments.
However, in 2014, she decided to try Qigong, a traditional form of Chinese exercise and trained under a professional. Since participating in the Qigong classes, Susan reports a significant improvement of approximately 90% in her pain and is now able to walk with minimal limitations. She has stopped receiving any medications or injections for pain relief and is enjoying her quality of life with the ability to complete her daily activities. 

Patient 2: James
James is a 70-year-old male with multi-level degenerative disc disease (DDD) and severe central spinal stenosis that resulted in progressively deteriorating muscle weakness in his legs. After his physician presented surgery as an option, James decided to forgo it and look for other alternatives. He tried yoga, but it only temporarily reduced his pain. One year later, he tried Qigong class and has been able to avoid any falls since then. James reports he has not experienced any pain and feels the practice gave him ""his life back"". He now has a ""spring in his step and heart"" and is reinvigorated to take on physical activities that he previously could not.

Both patients report significant improvements since discovering Qigong in their quality of life, mobility, and pain management.",,,0

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of neck pain, retrosternal oppressive chest pain, and progressive dyspnea. The patient's medical history included coronary heart disease, with a history of ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 2001 and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction in 2006. The patient had a permanent pacemaker installed in 2009 for sinus node dysfunction. An outpatient screening colonoscopy had been performed four hours prior to admission due to a positive immunochemical fecal occult blood and iron deficiency anemia.

The colonoscopy revealed a sessile polyp of 10mm in diameter in the cecum near the ileocecal valve, which was removed with the diathermic loop after the mucosa was infiltrated with adrenaline. Two further polyps were found in the ascending colon, both of approximately 7mm in diameter. During the polyp exeresis procedure, there was bleeding, and a hemostatic clip was placed near the ileocecal valve. No signs of perforations were noted during the procedure.

However, the patient started complaining of chest, abdominal, and neck pain and shortness of breath two hours after the completion of the procedure. The physical examination identified subcutaneous emphysema and clear crepitus on palpation on the neck, right anterior chest wall, and anterior and right lateral abdominal wall.

Additional tests, including blood tests, cardiac enzymes, inflammatory markers, hemogas analysis, electrocardiogram, and neck, chest, and abdominal X-rays, were conducted. The tests revealed right chest wall and cervical subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and bilateral subdiaphragmatic free air.

The abdominal and lower thorax contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed pneumoperitoneum and pneumoretroperitoneum, mainly located at the epimesogastrium, at the right anterior and posterior pararenal and perihepatic spaces, as well as diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.

Treatment:
The patient was admitted to the surgical department and treated conservatively. The treatment included absolute bowel rest, total parental nutrition, broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (ciprofloxacin 500 mg x 2 and metronidazole 500 mg x 3), and symptomatic care. The patient's condition improved, and indicators, including subcutaneous emphysema, pneumomediastinum, and pneumoretroperitoneum, began to resolve. A diet was initiated from water intake on the 5th day after the procedure, and the patient was switched to oral antibiotics instead of intravenous antibiotics. The patient was discharged on the 12th day after admission.

Follow-up Care:
The patient's condition was observed at the outpatient clinic one week after leaving the hospital, and he was confirmed to have fully recovered without any further complications.

Diagnosis:
Complications following colonoscopy, including pneumomediastinum, pneumoretroperitoneum, and subcutaneous emphysema, likely due to air leak post-polypectomy, and diverticulosis of the sigmoid colon.

Condition at Discharge:
The patient's condition was stable, and he had made a full recovery from the colonoscopy complications.

Follow-up Plan:
The patient will continue to be observed during his regular medical check-ups and will be monitored for any potential complications.",,,0

Patient: Mrs. X
Date of admission: [Date]
Date of discharge: [Date]

Hospital Course:

Mrs. X was admitted due to weakness and fatigue. The CBC showed normochromic normocytic anemia and high level of ferritin. The levels of total bilirubin and direct bilirubin were elevated, and the level of LDH was high. Direct and indirect Coombs tests were positive. Further tests revealed the diagnosis of Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM). She was treated with a combination of various medications. The patient did not experience any relapse episode during the hospital stay. 

Past Medical History:

Mrs. X had a history of eczema and dermatitis in the past. There was no other significant history of chronic disease or immunodeficiency disorder. The patient had a well-balanced diet, but a sedentary lifestyle with stress. She had normal body mass index and rarely used mobile phone. 

Social History:

Regarding social determinants of health, Mrs. X came from a family of middle socioeconomic status and lived in a crowded neighborhood. There were no significant familial or environmental risk factors for lymphoproliferative cancers including carcinogenic drugs, pesticides, herbicides, hair color, air freshener spray, detergents, tobacco or other chemical carcinogenic agents.

Impression:

Mrs. X was diagnosed with Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia. The treatment combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, dexamethasone and thalidomide proved to be effective against it. The patient's disease did not relapse during hospitalization. The patient had a well-balanced diet, but a sedentary lifestyle with stress.

Patient Information: 83-year-old female with bilateral primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) performed 17 years ago.

Hospital Course: The patient presented with worsening left knee pain, gait instability, and swelling for three months duration. The patient had been asymptomatic until this point. She had undergone physical therapy and left knee arthrocentesis, which showed proteinaceous fluid with few benign inflammatory and epithelial cells, but cultures were negative. The patient was referred to our institution for further evaluation where she reported steadily increasing, sharp pain localized to her left knee joint with associated swelling that worsened with ambulation and prolonged standing and lacked improvement with conservative management. A bilateral knee bone scan confirmed the tentative diagnosis of implant loosening with polyethylene wear and instability. The patient elected to undergo revision surgery of her left knee arthroplasty.

Hospital Course and Treatment: A classical anterior approach to the knee was made, and a medial release was performed. The patient's previous components were removed since her femoral component had bone ingrowth, which had encased the patella. Orthopaedic implants may cause a foreign body giant cell response, as was histologically evident in this case. Joint preparation was done in standard fashion, followed by revision of knee components.

Postoperative: Postoperative X-rays confirmed excellent placement of a left knee arthroplasty with no evidence of hardware failure or loosening. The patient experienced no postoperative complications and was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 2. The patient reported a well-controlled pain and reported that she was pleased with her new prosthesis.

Follow-up: The patient was asked to follow-up in the clinic two weeks postoperatively. X-rays performed at this time reported that the left knee arthroplasty was in an expected position, with no evidence of hardware failure or loosening. She reported that she was working well with physical therapy. 

Diagnosis: Left knee arthroplasty revision for implant loosening and polyethylene wear.

Condition on discharge: Stable.

Recommendations: The patient was advised to follow up with physical therapy and outpatient services periodically to monitor the progress of her left knee arthroplasty.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Incidentally discovered thyroid nodule

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted in April 2017 with a 1 cm thyroid nodule that was incidentally discovered during an ultrasound performed for another indication. Further tests revealed slightly elevated Ct levels, leading to a stimulation test with iv calcium, which showed the need for surgical treatment. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection (level VI) on the side of the tumor. The postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first postoperative day, which completely recovered 48 hours after surgery when the patient was discharged.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with a polilobulated medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) of 1 cm that was composed of cells with eosynophilic cytoplasm, agglomerated in solid nests with a predominantly expansive growth pattern. Immunohistochemistry tests showed that the tumor cells were positive for different proteins, such as Ct, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, and negative for the presence of amyloid. Focal foci of C-cells hyperplasia were spread in the whole gland. No metastases were found in any lymph nodes of the central compartment.

Clinical Features:
The patient presented an incidental thyroid nodule that was investigated further and diagnosed as a medullary thyroid cancer.

Treatment:
The patient underwent surgical treatment with a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection (level VI). There were no complications associated with the surgery.

Inpatient Diagnosis: Enlarged ovaries with torsion

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 34-year-old woman (gravida 4, para 1, abor 3) presented with pelvic pain and enlarged ovaries with multiple follicles. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks prior to presentation, and ultrasound imaging and computed tomography confirmed an ovarian enlargement of ≥10 cm with multiple follicles. Laboratory tests revealed a white blood cell count of 22.9 × 109/L, granulocyte rate of 80.6%, and a normal β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level. Initially, antibiotics were administered for 4 days to manage a transient fever. During the laparoscopic surgery, we found a torsed ovary and fallopian tube with localized congestion and necrosis near the biopsy site. Histopathological examination reported no associated lesions. Following surgery, GnRH analog was administered to the patient for 3 months. The patient’s condition improved, and the ovaries shrank in size during the first month of treatment (left ovary, 5.8 x 5.1 cm; right ovary, 9.3 x 6.3 cm). The patient reported no discomfort and was advised to return after 6 months with no further treatment. 

Discharge Instructions:

Admitting Diagnosis: Acute small bowel intestinal obstruction

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the emergency department with persistent abdominal pain. The medical team performed a contrast-enhanced MDCT which excluded significant dilatation of the gut but revealed an unusual accumulation of abdominal fat incarcerating mesenteric vessels and bowel segments in the midline of the anterior mesogastrium. Careful multiplanar analysis revealed the omental nature of the encircling fatty structure.

Selective volume-rendering reconstruction confirmed the whirl. Despite the fact that there was no critical dilatation nor suffering signs of the gut at the time of MDCT, the risk of occlusion was deemed important. The medical team therefore performed a laparotomy to address the complete omental whirl.

The patient's post-operative recovery was uneventful, and she was discharged in stable condition.

Patient Name: XXXX
Dates of Admission: XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX

Summary:
The patient is a 46-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with a history of a painless left supraclavicular mass and subsequent diagnosis of liquid silicone migration. The patient underwent multiple imaging studies, including ultrasound, CT, and MRI, which revealed a complex, heterogenous collection that extended from the left supraclavicular fossa into the left chest wall and the proximal, medial part of the left arm. The imaging studies also showed a slightly enhancing rim around arm collections that suggested superimposed inflammation or infection. After consented intravenous contrast administration, the patient again had a CT neck and left upper limb, which showed extensive hypodense material within the distribution of the previously identified silicone migration site with a new distribution of hypodense material in the left arm, correlating well with the ultrasonographical findings. A slightly enhancing rim surrounding the arm collection suggested superimposed inflammation or infection. Following a large volume of pus (within a fluid pocket extending from the medial aspect of the left arm to the left axilla and supraclavicular fossa) drainage, the patient was placed on intravenous cephalexin followed by a long course of oral flucloxacillin. The patient subsequently agreed to bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction after completing the treatment course.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to her general practitioner with a painless left supraclavicular mass and was referred to interventional radiology for further investigation and possible treatment of the presumed lymphangioma, which was later diagnosed as liquid silicone migration. The patient underwent ultrasound and non-contrast CT initially, which was of little help forming a differential diagnosis for the mass. Upon further investigation, the patient reported having had an elective mastopexy in Russia three years prior, which followed with free liquid silicone injection for fuller appearance. The patient’s history included recent domestic violence but denied any breast trauma. An MRI was performed to further define the mass and its vascularity before treatment, revealing a well-defined, T2 and STIR high signal complex cystic lesion extending from the lower anterior left neck posteriorly into the supraclavicular fossa, as well as an asymmetry of the injected material into both breasts, with silicone migrating around the lateral border of the left pectoralis major muscle. 

The patient was then diagnosed with liquid silicone migration and advised to undergo bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction. Later, the patient represented acutely unwell, septic, with a swollen, tense left biceps region and left upper limb cellulitis. Upon the suspected abscess collections being relayed to the treating surgical team, a large volume of pus (totalling approximately 600 ml) was drained. The patient received intravenous cephalexin followed by a long course of oral flucloxacillin.

Conclusions:
In conclusion, the patient was admitted with a painless left supraclavicular mass and later diagnosed with liquid silicone migration. The patient underwent ultrasound, non-contrast CT, and MRI studies to further investigate the mass. After contracting acute left upper limb cellulitis triggered by suspected abscess collections, the patient received intravenous cephalexin followed by a long course of oral flucloxacillin. The patient agreed to bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction after completing the treatment course.",,,0

Admission Date: [Redacted]
Discharge Date: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted due to deterioration of his pre-existing medical conditions, including pulmonary artery aneurysm, severe pulmonic regurgitation, and biventricular failure with an ejection fraction of 22%. The patient had undergone pulmonary artery resection with pulmonary homograft valve 27 mm implantation, resulting in significant improvement of his symptoms and an improved ejection fraction of 45%.

During the hospital stay, the patient developed acute respiratory distress, shortness of breath, and fever. He was found to have contracted Klebsiella pneumonia, which led to multiorgan system failure, including acute liver failure, acute renal failure, and respiratory failure requiring ventilator support. He was also diagnosed with acute-on-chronic systolic heart failure and pulmonary artery hypertension.

After the patient's multiorgan system failure had subsided, he was discharged from the hospital. He was later found to have reduced left lung volume with restrictive disease of unknown etiology.

Diagnosis:

The patient's medical history was suggestive of an underlying connective tissue disorder, and he had been labeled as having ""either Ehlers-Danlos or Loeys-Dietz syndrome"" due to the family history including cardiomyopathy in three paternal uncles, father, and sister.

Genetic testing identified the likely pathogenic variant c.1039 C>T (p.R347X) in TAB2 in a heterozygous state, which was responsible for the symptoms seen in the patient. The patient's sister was also diagnosed with the same TAB2 variant.

Treatment:

The patient was considered for a percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement or some form of mechanical circulatory support including a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), biventricular assist device (BIVAD), or total artificial heart while he waited for a transplant.

Outcome:

The patient's pulmonary valve regurgitation and pulmonary artery aneurysm worsened since his surgery at age 35, with the aneurysm reaching 5.2 cm.

Patient: 38-year-old male, with vitiligo and hypothyroidism
Diagnosis: Primary epithelioid angiomyolipoma (EAML) with metastatic disease
Hospital Course:

The patient initially presented in 2011 with gross hematuria, and was diagnosed with a 6-cm renal mass concerning for malignancy. He underwent right radical nephrectomy, and the pathology revealed a primary EAML with limited renal parenchyma involvement. The patient had an uneventful course for 3 years until monitoring identified an asymptomatic 13-cm renal fossa mass in 2014. Repeat surgical resection confirmed recurrent EAML, followed by a third surgical resection with indeterminate margins. In 2014, metastatic EAML was discovered after new retroperitoneal and pelvic implants were detected via surveillance imaging. 

The patient was initiated on everolimus in January 2015 based on a TSC2 deletion revealed during the FoundationOne® targeted next-generation sequencing. A follow-up imaging at 3 months showed a marked reduction in size of the majority of the soft tissue masses. Nonetheless, in September 2015, the patient reported unintended weight loss. Imaging identified slight enlargement of the dominant right renal fossa mass, with progressive anemia indicating disease progression. Everolimus was discontinued and a treatment-directed biopsy was conducted for consideration of a clinical trial.

Paired tumor-germline next-generation sequencing via MSK-IMPACT was performed, but there were no new somatic variants identified to explain the tumors’ acquired resistance. Thus, the patient was offered a clinical trial of off-label nivolumab via the Bristol-Myers Squibb Expanded Access program, and he received two cycles of treatment efficiently. Following nivolumab therapy, imaging after 5 cycles of nivolumab revealed responding disease, and the patient continued the treatment for a total of 2 years. Despite immune-related exacerbation of pre-existing hypothyroidism and cutaneous eruption primarily in areas of pre-existing vitiligo, no dose-limiting toxicities were reported by the patient. 

Nivolumab was discontinued in November 2017 after the patient had already completed 2 years of therapy, as it was deemed that the toxicities would become more severe. The most recent imaging demonstrated continued response and interval calcification of the patient's intra-abdominal tumors. Playback tissue derived from the surgical resection showed high PD-L1 expression and preserved expression of key DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, and MLH1, confirming MMR proficiency. 

Disposition: The patient was discharged from hospital care upon the completion of nivolumab therapy. Further follow-up was recommended to monitor any future disease progression.",,,0

Hospital Course:
- The patient was admitted to the hospital due to exertional dyspnea and right ventricular (RV) heart failure progressing since last 12 months to functional class IV.
- On admission, the patient was in WHO functional class IV, saturation on room air was 85%, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 90 beats per minute. Mild peripheral edema was present.
- Distance covered in 6 min walk test (6MWT) was 100 m with desaturation to 77%.
- Plasma natriuretic peptide (NT-pro-BNP) concentration was elevated to 6239 pg/ml (normal range < 125 pg/ml).
- Echocardiography showed severe RV pressure overload with TRPG 95 mmHg, dilatation of both right atrium and ventricle.
- Chest CT scan showed signs of advanced interstitial lung fibrosis and calcified mediastinal lymph nodes. However, organized thrombi in both pulmonary were also detected.
- Lung perfusion scan with SPECT/CT showed bilateral perfusion defects which strongly suggested thromboembolic component of PH.
- Right heart catheterization (RHC) followed by selective pulmonary angiography (PAG) showed mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) of 54 mmHg. Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP) was 6 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was 13,5 Wood Units. Selective PAG confirmed chronic thromboembolic lesions suggestive of CTEPH - left upper lobe artery occlusion, intravascular webs in right pulmonary artery.
- The patient underwent a balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) procedure in order to treat the CTEPH. The procedure included intravascular imaging with optical coherence tomography (OCT) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to confirm intraluminal localization of thromboembolic lesions. With the use of a pressure catheter, pulmonary pressure ratio (PPR) was assessed in arteries A9 and A10 to optimize the BPA procedure and to minimize potential complications such as reperfusion pulmonary injury (RPI). After simultaneous inflation of balloon catheters - ""kissing balloon"" technique, followed by proximal optimization with other balloon catheter, there were no periprocedural complications. This procedure resulted in further hemodynamic and functional improvement, with mPAP drop to 27 mmHg at 12 months follow-up.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of bloody purulent stool, fever, erythema, and blisters on the face. The patient had been diagnosed with UC three years prior but did not receive regular treatment as prescribed. The initial laboratory examination yielded an elevated white blood cell count, increased C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and Epstein-Barr virus DNA levels and a low hemoglobin level. The computed tomography and computed tomographic enterography exhibited extensive colonic wall thickening with a few perienteral exudative changes and multiple lymph nodes in the retroperitoneal and mesangial areas consistent with the characteristics of UC. Biopsies of cutaneous lesions were performed, revealing localized epidermal ulceration with neutrophil infiltration and dermal appendages with the infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells and neutrophils. A clinical diagnosis of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis was considered. After ruling out other infectious diseases and lymphoproliferative syndrome, corticosteroid treatment was initiated despite high levels of EBV DNA. There was no recurrence of SS within three months. Colonoscopy revealed scattered polypoid hyperplasia from the ascending colon to the sigmoid colon. Histology of the resected polyp was characterized by crypt dilatation, branching, twisting with interstitial edema, local interstitial fibrosis, and muscle fiber penetration growth. Localized neutrophils infiltrated into the epithelium to form cryptonitis. These histological results were consistent with the characteristics of MPPs.

Patient Susan, a 10.9-year-old female, was admitted to the pediatric ward with a history of frequent stomach pains of no known medical cause and school refusal. During the admission, it was observed that she had developed repeat episodes of viral gastroenteritis over a two week period which left her convinced that resuming eating had caused her gastrointestinal symptoms. As a result, she progressively ate less and lost weight. Susan had undergone a full medical work-up but no pathology was identified. She was admitted weighing 75.8% of TGW (BMI 11.8 kg/m2), and initially re-nourished with liquid nutrition (Ensure) via nasogastric tube, but weight gain was very slow and difficult. She refused to eat or drink, would kick and scream and become hysterical whenever food was presented, and screamed throughout the duration of her NG feeds.

Treatment:

Susan was initiated on olanzapine over the course of her admission to help with her severe agitation and anxiety, and cognitive behavioural therapy was utilized. Moreover, her mother was taught to support her, e.g. by providing soothing massage, empathy and whatever helped Susan to tolerate taking the nutrition. Susan insisted that all that helped was walking, and gradually Susan's intake increased, along with her weight, and the pain and hysterical sobbing lessened. At the end of treatment (after 6 therapy sessions but with follow-up by the AM physician over a total of 3.5 months), she was able to eat all foods, was able to socialize and participate in sports, and was able to eat without issue at restaurants which previously caused anxiety as well.

Discharge:

Susan was discharged home two months after admission, at 100% of her initial TGW. Following discharge, she continued weekly family therapy sessions. She had exhibited separation anxiety and school avoidance which resolved over time. Fluoxetine was initiated and titrated over the following months up to 40 mg/day.

Admitting Diagnosis: Edentulous left mandible secondary to partial mandibulectomy surgery

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 29-year-old Pakistani male who was admitted to the Oral Surgery Department for rehabilitation of the left edentulous mandible secondary to partial mandibulectomy surgery. The patient has undergone two operations for the left body of a mandible keratocyst odontogenic tumour (KCOT). The patient reported an absence of paraesthesia on the left mandible. He has been reviewed regularly and requested to have a replacement of his missing teeth on the lower left side due to difficulty eating and the effect on his appearance. 

On clinical examination, the patient had an asymmetrical face with a slightly depressed left lower body of the mandible on a class I skeletal pattern. The smile line was high exposing the gingiva on the upper maxillary incisors. Intraorally, the oral hygiene was fair with the presence of mild gingivitis. The dentition on the maxillary arch was unrestored. The left edentulous mandible was irregular basal bone with firm mucosa covering the bone from 41 until 37. There were marked loss of bony structure horizontally and vertically. This has caused the tongue to occupy the space that used to be occupied by teeth and alveolus in the left mandibular segment. The healing of the operation site was uneventful.

An orthopantomogram was taken to evaluate the remaining bony structure of the mandible. Radiographically, the operation site (lower left posterior segment) has no abnormalities. The remaining basal bone was adequate in thickness to support the mandible with an irregular margin. There are no radiopaque abnormalities suggestive of new pathology.

In consideration of the above, and the opinions of relevant healthcare professionals, the patient is clinically stable and able to be discharged.

Discharge Diagnosis: Edentulous left mandible secondary to partial mandibulectomy surgery

Discharge Plan: The patient's discharge plan is to provide referral for replacement of his missing teeth on the lower left side. The patient will be followed up on an as-needed basis and referred to a specialist if new symptoms arise.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our institution after being referred due to an ultrasound finding of ascites and a pre-surgical computed tomography (CT) scan that showed thickening of the gastric walls, multiple omental nodules, and ascites. The patient underwent further diagnostic examinations, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy, which returned negative results for cancer.
During her hospital stay, the patient underwent a comprehensive metabolic profile and tumour markers assessment. Increased levels of CA125 were detected, whereas carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19.9, and other immunohistochemical markers were within normal ranges. Serological assessments for HIV, hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis B virus were negative.
A biopsy was performed on the patient, resulting in a diagnosis of suspicious carcinoma from an unknown primary site. However, two weeks later, the patient received a CT scan of the thorax that showed a spontaneous reduction in size and number of peritoneal lesions, as well as resolution of peri-hepatic and peri-splenic ascites.
To further exclude malignancy, the patient underwent a laparoscopic surgery, which showed no evidence of the presence of malignant cells. Instead, the final pathological diagnosis reported necrotising inflammation caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria.
The patient was subsequently transferred to a hospital with expertise in infectious diseases. A follow-up CT scan performed one year later confirmed complete recovery of peritoneal findings.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient was admitted to our institution due to the suspicion of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Multiple diagnostic examinations were performed, including biopsy and CT scans, resulting in the eventual diagnosis of necrotising inflammation caused by non-tuberculous mycobacteria. The patient underwent laparoscopic surgery, which excluded the presence of malignant cells and confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was transferred to a hospital with expertise in infectious diseases for further management.

The patient was admitted to our hospital after presenting to the emergency department with sudden onset dysphagia and odynophagia accompanied by a severe left C6 radicular pain. The patient was diagnosed with a radiopaque foreign body that was 3.5 cm in size in the upper cervical esophagus which was located in the left C5-6 neural foramen and was abutting the left vertebral artery.

Treatment:

Endoscopic removal of the foreign body was deferred due to the proximity of neurovascular structures. Therefore, the patient was treated with an anterior cervical approach. The foreign body was located and completely extracted with no injury to the vertebral artery. Post-procedure, the patient had immediate relief of her left radicular pain after recovery from anesthesia and caring for the procedure site. The patient was subsequently started on a Ryle's tube feed for a week and then started on a regular oral diet. The patient was discharged in stable condition.

Follow-Up:

The patient was advised to follow up with their primary care physician for further evaluation and management. The patient was also advised to report any signs of recurrent pain or difficulty swallowing to their primary care physician.",,,0

Patient: 10-day-old male infant with suspected congenital hypothyroidism and airway obstruction due to ectopic thyroid.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to airway obstruction caused by an ectopic thyroid that was compressing the epiglottis. A hormonal test revealed subclinical hypothyroidism with an increased thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level that was beyond the normal range. The patient received oral levothyroxine to lower the TSH level and reduce the volume of the ectopic thyroid tissue. However, his symptoms of airway obstruction did not abate, and he eventually underwent surgery after he turned 2 months old.

Procedure:
The surgery was performed under general anesthesia to relieve the airway obstruction caused by the ectopic thyroid. The surgeon made a transverse skin incision measuring 2.5 cm at the level of the hyoid bone and split the hyoid bone at the midline. They then dissected the base of the tongue towards the foramen cecum, detected the ectopic thyroid mass, and suspended the mass by suturing it to the hyoid bone. The degree of suspension of the ectopic thyroid was guided by an intraoperative laryngo fiberscopy to confirm the complete elevation of the epiglottis.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged 4 days postoperatively and required noninvasive positive pressure ventilation until postoperative day 22. Follow-up laryngo fiberscopy performed 6 months postoperatively revealed the complete disappearance of compression of the epiglottis by the lingual mass, and CT performed 8 months postoperatively also revealed the relocation of the lingual thyroid gland towards the hyoid bone. At 2 years and 6 months old, the patient's thyroid hormone levels were stable and he was able to maintain his status as euthyroid. The postoperative control of his thyroid hormone status was relatively easy, as his thyroid gland was preserved. The patient did experience a salivary fistula that spontaneously resolved 5 months postoperatively.

Summary:
This discharge summary documents the admission of a 10-day-old male infant who was admitted to the hospital due to airway obstruction caused by an ectopic thyroid. After undergoing surgery to relieve the obstruction, the patient was discharged and made a full recovery. Ongoing follow-up has shown stable thyroid hormone levels and no major complications.",,,1

Patient: 64-year-old male teacher
Date of Admission: [DATE]
Date of Discharge: [DATE]

Hospital Course:
The patient was initially evaluated for an inability to flex the interphalangeal (IP) joint of his left thumb, after an incident while gardening where he felt a pop in his thumb. There was no evidence of inflammatory arthritis or bony abnormalities resulting in secondary tendon rupture. MRI revealed a complete rupture of the flexor pollicis longus (FPL) tendon, which was subsequently repaired via the modified Becker method. The distal end of the ruptured tendon revealed slightly yellowish denatured tissue and a fibrous tissue was observed at the gap of the ruptured ends. Histopathology revealed normal vasculature and degenerative changes with lipid deposits in the tendon tissue. The patient's thumb was immobilized in a below-elbow plaster splint with extension block for 1 week, and followed by dynamic splinting for another 6 weeks, and unrestricted full active motion at week 7. 

Outcome:
At 12-month follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic and had excellent range of motion of IP joint in his left thumb (0°–40°) with wrist grip strength of 30 kg and thumb pinch strength of 5.7 kg. The Quick DASH score was 0, indicating excellent functional status. 

Assessment:
The patient presented with a complete FPL tendon rupture with no evidence of inflammatory arthritis or bony abnormalities resulting in secondary tendon rupture.

Gender: Female
Date of Birth: [redacted]
Final Diagnosis: Adult Onset Still's Disease (AOSD)

Hospital Course:
The 32-year-old patient presented with high fever, abdominal pain, and anorexia when she was 16 years of age. The patient experienced similar symptoms over the next 4 years leading to multiple hospital admissions with elevated C-reactive protein levels, and traces of protein in urine. Diagnostic tests including blood and urine cultures, and abdominal ultrasound revealed no obvious pathology. Upon sudden onset of polyarthritis, fever, and widespread skin rash at age 21, the patient's acute phase reaction was highly elevated with hyperferritinemia. The diagnosis of AOSD was established based on typical clinical features and exclusion of other autoimmune rheumatological diseases. The patient responded well initially to oral corticosteroids, though attempts to introduce DMARDS including hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, and methotrexate were largely ineffective. Following treatment with tocilizumab, the patient ceased long-term corticosteroid use and has remained well-controlled on tocilizumab monotherapy for the past 2 years.

Family History:
Inquiries into the patient's family history revealed two children with unexplained inflammatory symptoms. The patient's daughter experienced recurrent episodes of malaise, high fever, erythematous skin rash, and mouth ulcers from 8 months of age and later developed episodic abdominal pain and knee pain that disappeared between the episodes. Since being prescribed colchicine, the daughter has not had further inflammatory episodes or symptoms. The patient's son also experienced monthly high fever episodes since age 5, which were occasionally accompanied by vomiting, mouth ulcers, and a salmon-pink rash. Colchicine treatment has been less effective for the son. The father of the patient has early onset RA, but limited information on symptoms and diagnostic tests is available.

Treatment and Follow-Up:
Following the patient's response to tocilizumab treatment, she was discharged with instructions to continue monthly IV infusion at current dosing and attend follow-up appointments with the rheumatologist. No further investigations or treatments were recommended at this time.

Complications and Comorbidities:
None reported.

Recommendations for Primary Care:
The patient should continue to receive tocilizumab treatment at monthly dosing. Any significant changes in symptoms or side-effects should be reported immediately to the rheumatologist. The patient's children should undergo further evaluations of their inflammatory symptoms.

Follow-Up Care Plan:
The patient is expected to continue follow-up appointments with the rheumatologist to monitor her response to tocilizumab treatment.",,,1

Age: 33
Admission Date: [redacted]
Discharge Date: [redacted]

Admission Diagnosis:

Severe postburn mentosternal contracture and cicatricial carcinoma.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for skin grafting surgery due to a severe burn that occurred when she was four years old. She had undergone two reconstructive procedures in local medical centers at the ages of seven and 14. The patient presented with severe scar contractures and a large tumor of approximately 15 × 12 cm on the lower lip, neck, and anterior chest. In addition, the patient had limited mouth opening (15 mm) and Mallampati test could not be performed. The patient had tried several medical centers for treatment in the past year, but had failed for unsuccessful airway topicalization and intubation (ATI). Due to the pain caused by the occurrence of cicatricial carcinoma, affecting eating and speaking, the patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation and management.

During the preoperative physical examination, the patient's chin, chest, and bilateral armpits fused together; the cervicomental and mentosternal angles were completely obliterated; the anterior neck structures, including the larynx, the trachea, and the carotid arteries, were unidentifiable or impalpable. The left nostril was obstructive for stenosis, but the right nostril breathing was smooth. Preoperative X-rays and a computed tomography scan revealed distortion of the upper airway and no stenosis of the trachea. Face mask ventilation could not be performed due to the nearly fixed neck and regressed mandible. According to guidelines on the management of difficult airway, an awake flexible bronchoscopic intubation with topicalization was considered the preferred approach; however, the patient rejected ATI for discomfort and nociceptive recall before. Other awake strategies, including lightwand, GlideScopeⓇ Video laryngoscope, laryngeal mask airway, oral or nasal blind intubation, retrograde intubation, surgical tracheostomy, seemed impossible. Therefore, a flexible bronchoscopic intubation protocol under precise sedation, topicalization, and spontaneous respiration preservation was scheduled.

After obtaining a written informed consent with explanation focused on the risks of difficult airway and intramuscular injection of Atropine 0.5 mg to reduce secretion 30 minutes before transferring to the operating room, the patient was monitored for respiration rate, ventilation volume, pulse oximetry, electrocardiogram, blood pressure and bispectral index (BIS). Preoxygenation was performed once the patient arrived in the operating room and intravenous midazolam 2 mg and sufentanil 5 μg were administered. Nasal passage was anesthetized by pledgets with 2% lidocaine and 0.25% phenylephrine. Sevoflurane 2% with a flow rate of 4 L/min with 100% O2 was administered via an endoscopic mask connected to the ventilator circuit. The concentration of sevoflurane was gradually increased to 4% and stopped when the BIS reached 55-60 within 3 minutes, then airway reassessment and precise topicalization were achieved by a modified SAYGO technique.

An epidural catheter, with an outer diameter of 3.8 mm and 1.5 cm longer, was fixed to the fiberscope (MDH A10; Zhuhai Mindhao Medical Technology Co., Ltd., ShenZhen, China). Topicalization was achieved by spraying 2% lidocaine (7 ml) via the catheter onto the posterior nasal canal, pharyngeal cavity, epiglottis, glottis, and tracheal. Meanwhile, supplemental oxygen 10 L/min was delivered by a hose through the mouth to avoid hypoxemia. When lidocaine worked, about 5 minutes later, sevoflurane was inhaled again until the BIS reached 55–60. Then, a Parker Flex-Tip® tube with an inner diameter of 6.0 mm (Lead Medical Instrument Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China), which was heated by 40 ℃ and lubricated in advance, was successfully and smoothly inserted into the trachea from the direction of flexible bronchoscopy. No stress reactions and no intubation-related complications occurred during intubation, and the patient was very satisfied with this experience after emergence.

The patient was admitted to the pediatric ICU with findings of severe anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis with circulating blasts. Initial workup revealed a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), confirmed by molecular analysis of the peripheral blood. The patient was treated emergently with ATRA, dexamethasone, allopurinol, cefepime, and blood products including packed red blood cells, platelets, and cryoprecipitate. She received several transfusions with platelets, cryoprecipitate, and fresh frozen plasma to manage DIC. She was continued on an induction course of chemotherapy including ATRA, dexamethasone, idarubicin, and arsenic trioxide. A lumbar puncture was performed and intrathecal chemotherapy was administered, which revealed the presence of leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, confirming the involvement of the central nervous system. The patient's encephalopathy gradually improved and she returned to her baseline mental status by day 7 of treatment. The patient was noted to have elevated opening pressure on lumbar punctures, which worsened over the course of induction, attributed to pseudotumor cerebri secondary to ATRA. Upon completion of the first 28 days of induction therapy, repeat lumbar puncture and bone marrow studies demonstrated no morphologic evidence of acute promyelocytic leukemia, consistent with remission.

Admitting Diagnosis: Benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with progressively worsening abdominal pain and constipation. Physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal tenderness and a hypogastric mass. A CT scan showed the presence of 3 contiguous and communicating cystic formations, localized at the level of the mesentery, and some other similar lesions. An exploratory laparotomy was performed, and a voluminous cystic mass composed of 3 confluent formations, with a major axis equal to about 10 cm, was observed and removed. Scar adhesions due to previous nephrectomy hampered the procedure.

Postoperatively, on the 8th day, the patient developed a circumscribed peritonitis due to dehiscence of the ileoileal anastomosis. Another operation was performed to resect the anastomotic site. A delayed return of normal bowel function was resolved through prokinetic therapy with levosulpiride and neostigmine methylsulfate.

Upon histological examination, the mass was found to be benign multicystic peritoneal mesothelioma. The patient was discharged 33 days after the first operation in good condition.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the outpatient dermatology clinic for a scalp lesion of three weeks duration. Examination revealed a mobile, round, exophytic nodule with overlying ulceration and hemorrhagic crust, approximately 1.5 cm in diameter. Given a high clinical suspicion of malignancy, the lesion was excised three weeks following the initial visit using a fusiform (elliptical) incision with 1 cm margins. A histopathologic examination of an excisional biopsy of the cutaneous lesion revealed a proliferation of spindle and pleomorphic tumor cells consistent with invasive pleomorphic dermal sarcoma. The tumor measured 3.3 cm at the largest dimension, and tumor cells were found to be present at the surgical margin.

Preparatory computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed an approximately 3.9 cm focus of enhancement with central ulceration in the soft tissue of the posterior scalp and confirmed a lack of bony erosion in the underlying calvarium. No metastatic adenopathy was appreciated. A wide local excision was planned with a 2 cm margin around the remaining tumor for a 7.5 cm area of planned excision. The repair utilized a 7x3.5 cm full-thickness skin graft from the left upper chest.

The immediate post-surgical course was uncomplicated. Wound care with sterile petrolatum gauze dressing sutured to the scalp for two weeks helped with successful graft healing. At the one-month follow-up after the operation, a review of systems did not reveal systemic relapse and an examination of the surgical scar and cervical lymph nodes did not reveal local recurrence.

Plan:

The patient will continue to have close monitoring by the dermatology team twice per year.

2009,"Discharge Summary:

Patient Overview:
The patient is a 21-year-old male who was admitted to our care due to fever, generalized pruritus, and nonblanching petechial and papular skin rash. Initial laboratory results showed normal white blood cell count with mild lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive protein, positive antinuclear antibody, and elevated liver function tests.

Hospital Course:
During his stay, the patient was suspected to have Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) and was initiated on doxycycline therapy. Viral and tick serologies for RMSF, Lyme, and Ehrlichia were negative. The patient continued to have persistent fever with a significant malaise, developed bilateral uveitis, and a palpable mass in the right chest wall. Imaging studies showed ground glass opacities of right middle and lower lobes of the lungs and moderately fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid mediastinal, hilar, and axillary lymph nodes.

Diagnostic Process:
Following an excisional biopsy of a right chest wall lymph node, the patient was diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). After initiating vinblastine and prednisone therapy, the patient had symptomatic improvement and a decrease in FDG-avid lesions on imaging studies. Further, next-generation sequencing on tissue biopsy did not reveal any mutations, including mitogen-activated kinases (MAPK) pathway alterations. However, during his stay, a histopathological review of his lymph node biopsy indicated that the paracortex was expanded by a mixed population of Langerhans cells, pigment-laden histiocytes, and small lymphocytes, pointing toward florid dermatopathic lymphadenopathy.

Patient Progress:
Following this diagnosis, the patient continued to improve clinically and was discharged after his symptoms subsided. The patient will need regular follow-ups and surveillance to monitor their progress.

Significant Findings:
This case emphasizes the importance of histopathological re-evaluation when the clinicopathological correlation is under ambiguity.

Diagnosis:
Florid dermatopathic lymphadenopathy.",,,0
1282,"Medical History: 
The patient is a 38-year-old nulliparous woman with a history of infertility who underwent assisted reproductive technologies including artificial insemination and in vitro fertilization. During this time, she was diagnosed with a stage IB1 cervical squamous cell carcinoma with a 1 cm mass in the uterine cervix. CT scans showed no signs of lymph node swelling or distant metastases.

Hospital Course: 
The patient underwent an abdominal radical trachelectomy followed by abdominal myomectomy to resect the submucosal myoma. A frozen section procedure was performed during the surgery which confirmed a free cervical margin of 5mm. A permanent cerclage was then placed and the uterus was reanastomosed to the vagina. The final histological specimen confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing type of cervix uteri, pT1B1.

Follow-Up:
No adjuvant treatment was administered, and at least 18 months postoperatively, there has been no recurrence of her cervical cancer. Six months after the surgery, she became pregnant following the postoperative first embryo transfer. She delivered a male baby at 26 weeks due to chorioamnionitis. The baby received general care in a neonatal intensive care unit for four months and is now 6 months old and well.

Patient Information
Name: [redacted]
Gender: Female
Age: 23 years

Hospital Course Summary
The patient was admitted with a 4-month history of fluctuating weakness of the right upper and lower extremities associated with a band-like sensation of the trunk along with bowel and bladder disturbances. There was also a month-long history of neck movement-related electric-like sensation on the nape. Weakness progressed to the left lower extremity causing difficulty in ambulation and eventually became quadriparetic. The patient's condition deteriorated and she developed dysphagia, dysphonia, difficulty breathing, and projectile vomiting.

Initial Assessment
The patient was hemodynamically stable upon admission with no spinal deformities noted. She had lax sphincter tone and hypesthesia was described. The patient was hyper-reflexic on both the upper and lower extremities along with bilateral extensor toe sign.

Diagnostic Tests
Initial work-up included a cranio-spinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing a long expansile contrast-enhancing mass involving the entire spinal cord, from the level of the cervical region to the conus medullaris with extension to the lower medulla oblongata. 

Medical Management
The patient was started on dexamethasone, which provided minimal relief of symptoms. She was referred to the neurosurgery service and was advised for surgery.

Outcome
Unfortunately, on the 20th hospital day, the patient's symptoms progressed to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. She subsequently developed healthcare-associated pneumonia succumbing to septicemia.

Autopsy
On autopsy, all lobes of the lungs were consolidated secondary to pneumonia. There was swelling of the entire spinal cord with white to yellow mucoid material coming out from the central canal. Cut sections showed that the entire spinal cord and caudal medullary region were replaced by mucoid material. Histopathologic examination of the spinal cord revealed a cellular tumor arranged around the central canal of the cord. The cells are generally small, with round to slightly ovoid nuclei. Fibrillary processes were noted in the cytoplasm.

Diagnosis
The patient was diagnosed with holocord oligodendroglioma.

Recommendation
Further genetic characterization of the tumor such as IDH, 1p/19q codeletion, MGMT, EGFR and TP53 mutations were not done because of its unavailability in the institution but its histologic and immunochemical features are consistent with holocord oligodendroglioma.",,,1

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:

Admitted to the hospital with recurring episodes of severe central chest pain. Initial electrocardiogram did not show any significant ST segment shifts, but elevated troponin I levels were detected. The patient was suspected of having non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and was referred for coronary angiography. A moderate stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) was discovered upon angiography. However, assessment of the physiological significance of the stenosis was not possible, as the wire could not advance to the lesion. Imaging revealed a stump of the left main coronary artery (LMCA) with occlusion of both the LAD and of the circumflex (LCx) coronary arteries. Severe anterior ST segment elevation occurred, and the patient became progressively hypotensive with systolic pressure falling to a nadir of 58 mmHg; Inotropic and pressor infusions were commenced.

A decision was made to implement mechanical circulatory support with the Impella CP device before attempting to reestablish patency of the left coronary system with stents. After access was gained, the patient developed ventricular fibrillation and immediately received one 150-Joule biphasic nonsynchronized shock. Following that, a long 8F arterial sheath and an Impella 0.18″ deployment wire were used to deploy the Impella CP device. The Impella device was then activated and placed on ""auto mode."" The mean arterial pressure increased to 80 mmHg, and there was no recurrence of ventricular dysrhythmias.

After implementing mechanical circulatory support, the vessels were dilated with 2.0 mm × 20 mm and 2.5 mm × 20 mm Trek balloons, which restored flow first in the LAD and then in the LCx. A 3.0 mm × 18 mm Resolute stent was placed from the LM to the LAD, and the LCx was rewired through the LAD stent struts. Then, the LCx was stented with a 3.0 mm × 38 mm Resolute stent and later deployed with a 3.0 mm × 20 mm Trek balloon, which was placed within the LAD stent. Final deployment of the stents was with simultaneous inflation of the two balloons (kissing balloon dilation). Finally, a 4.0 mm × 9 mm Resolute stent was deployed from the shaft to the ostium of the LM. Angiography showed reestablishment of the LM, LAD, and LCx patency, and intravascular ultrasound of the LAD and LM showed good stent apposition in these vessels. A 2D echocardiogram was performed, which showed normal left ventricle (LV) systolic function with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 55%.

The patient was successfully weaned from the Impella device while in the cardiac catheterization laboratory after demonstrating a mixed venous oxygen saturation ≥ 65% on P3. Due to the rapid identification of shock and the prompt recovery of mean arterial pressure, pressor support was discontinued. A technique of crossover balloon tamponade was employed due to the emergent need for Impella support. Follow-up coronary angiography after six months of the initial procedure showed continuing patency of the left coronary system without any significant residual stenosis.

Disposition:

Patient was discharged home two days after the procedure. At the 24-month clinical follow-up, the patient remains angina-free and with continuing normal LV systolic function. No recurrence of symptoms, hemodynamic abnormalities, or dysrhythmias were noticed.",,,0

Hospital Course:

The 61-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of constipation. Colonoscopy revealed a lower rectal tumor. Following biopsy, it was determined that the patient had moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma.

Enhanced Computed Tomography (CT) imaging showed a bulky middle to lower rectal tumor and multiple regional lymph nodes without distant metastasis. The patient was diagnosed with stage IIIa rectal cancer according to the Japanese Classification of Colorectal Carcinoma 8th edition.

Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy was administered to the patient, involving a combination of pelvic radiation (total of 45 Gy for 5 weeks) and concurrent chemotherapy with irinotecan and S-1.

Three weeks after the completion of NAT, the patient returned to the hospital on an emergency basis. An emergency colonoscopy revealed an obstruction in the lower rectum where the primary tumor was located, leading to a partial response of the tumor to NAT.

A Self-Expanding Metal Stent (SEMS) was implanted as treatment, providing significant relief to the patient and allowing for his discharge 3 days after the procedure.

Laparoscopic low anterior resection with a diverting ileostomy was performed on the patient 3 weeks after SEMS placement with good results. The patient experienced no postoperative complications and was discharged on day 14 after the procedure.

Adjuvant chemotherapy with Capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (XELOX) was initiated 5 weeks after the surgery was performed. The patient has been alive without recurrence for 26 months since his treatment.

2349,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted and treated for locally advanced rectal cancer. He underwent neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgical resection and subsequently received adjuvant modified FOLFOX6 followed by colostomy reversal. However, two years later, a CT imaging revealed new retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy suspicious for metastatic disease. He was then treated with several lines of therapies including FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab, an investigational therapy, regorafenib, and eventually anti-EGFR antibody therapy (panitumumab) which had disease control for seven months but eventually discontinued due to disease progression.

Clinical Status:

The patient was then enrolled in a phase Ib clinical trial combining cabozantinib and panitumumab (NCT02008383). The patient was increasingly symptomatic due to extensive pulmonary metastases with worsening cough and shortness of breath. After ~6 weeks of treatment, CT demonstrated dramatic improvement in his pulmonary tumor burden, as well as resolution of dyspnea and cough. Due to marked treatment response and tumor involution, treatment was discontinued when anastomotic dehiscence and a leak with abscess evolution occurred.

CfDNA Profiling:

Plasma-EDTA collected before the start of treatment was used to explore potential drivers of treatment response and/or resistance. Blood-based profiling revealed subclonal EGFR, KRAS and BRAF resistance mutations. Additionally, EGFR amplification and MET amplification were observed in cfDNA but not in tissue obtained 3 months prior. CfDNA profiling performed after 28 days of treatment revealed loss of MET and EGFR amplification, while the mutant allele frequency (MAF) of KRAS G13D increased from 0.3 to 0.6%. There was also a nearly 10-fold decrease in MAF of TP53 R213* post treatment, likely correlating with the dramatic reduction of tumor burden.

Discharge Plan:

After 2 months off therapy, the patient's CEA increased, and his dyspnea and cough returned. Capecitabine was initiated, and panitumumab was added 2 months later for additional control. He experienced brief stabilization of disease on capecitabine and panitumumab, with subjective improvement of his pulmonary symptoms. However, he then experienced disease progression and was transitioned to hospice. He died ~10 months after discontinuing cabozantinib and panitumumab.",,,0
2212,"Hospital Course:

The patient was a 31-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with complaints of right-sided chest pain, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and associated shortness of breath. A fall at work five weeks prior resulted in the development of the chest pain as per the patient history. The patient was tachycardic and tender over his lower right ribs. The chest X-Ray showed a pleural lesion in the right hemothorax. The subsequent CT scan revealed an expansile lytic lesion and multiple lytic deposits. A skeletal survey revealed multiple lesions on the skull, pelvic bone, and proximal right femur. The patient underwent various investigations, including serum protein electrophoresis, which revealed high gamma globulin and a monoclonal band. Bone marrow biopsy revealed sheets of plasma cells, indicative of multiple myeloma. 

Treatment:

The patient was started on cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CyBorD) for four cycles. There was a partial hematologic response, and the patient relapsed after four months of therapy. The treatment strategy was changed to lenalidomide and dexamethasone, and he is currently undergoing treatment to achieve hematologic remission.

The patient was admitted to the hospital with a painless mass in the left neck. The patient underwent a needle biopsy, followed by referral to our hospital. A physical examination was conducted, which revealed a well-defined and lobulated mass measuring approximately 10 × 10 cm. The plain X-ray radiographs showed a soft tissue mass in the left neck with no calcification.

A MRI scan was performed, which revealed heterogeneity with higher signal intensity than muscle on T1-weighted images, low-signal intensity in the septum on T2-weighted images, complete suppression of the signal on T2-weighted fat-suppressed images, and enhancement of the signal on gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images. A PET scan was also conducted, showing a Single-Unit Vehicle Maximum (SUVmax) of 1.84, with no abnormal uptake except in the mass. Another needle biopsy was performed, and subsequent evaluation resulted in a final diagnosis of chondroid lipoma.

The mass was removed surgically since it was considered a low-grade tumor. The surgical procedure performed was a resection that was marginally successful, as the mass was encapsulated and markedly harder than a well-differentiated liposarcoma, with a yellowish and lobulated cut-surface. Upon histological examination, the tumor was seen to be composed of myxoid and cartilaginous matrix, and mature fat cells as well as lipoblast-like cells. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the tumor cells were negative for CDK4, MDM2, MIB1, and Sox9. There was no recurrence observed a year after surgery.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient, a 73-year-old female, presented with dyspnea on exertion. Chest radiography revealed an enlarged mediastinal silhouette. Preoperative CT and echocardiography revealed a giant cyst (12 × 10 cm in diameter) occupying a large area around the left atrium and ventricle, and it was present behind the pulmonary artery. Percutaneous cystocentesis was performed, and 800 ml of serous liquid was aspirated. However, 1 week after cystocentesis, the cyst recurred, and its size was the same as that before the procedure. Therefore, resection was planned.

OPERATIVE PROCEDURE:

Open surgery through median sternotomy was performed. The cyst was found to be attached to the visceral pericardium involving the left atrium and pulmonary artery. The cyst was most tightly attached to the main pulmonary artery. Thus, it was thought to have originated from the pulmonary artery. The content fluid was aspirated via direct puncture, and the cyst wall was completely dissected with an ultrasonic scalpel. The surgery was successfully completed without CPB.

POSTOPERATIVE COURSE:

The postoperative course was uneventful. CT confirmed absence of cyst recurrence or pericardial effusion. There has been no recurrence of the cyst since discharge (2 years).

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

The patient was diagnosed with a giant epicardial cyst originating from the pulmonary artery.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 34-year-old mother of two children in her 29th week of pregnancy, was admitted with hypertension and diagnosed with gdma2. She experienced hyperadrenergic spells associated with episodic palpitation, headache, and sweating. A multidisciplinary team meeting was held to decide on the management of her pregnancy. She was prescribed medications to control her blood pressure and blood sugar.

Her delivery was done by elective caesarean section at 36 weeks of gestation. Peripartum period was uneventful. After one month postpartum, the patient presented with a sudden onset headache and vomiting. She was transferred to the neurosurgical unit where she was diagnosed with multiloculated cystic lesions suggestive of cerebellar hemangioblastomas. She was given ventriculoperitoneal shunting as an emergency procedure, followed by laparoscopic right adrenalectomy to remove the right-sided adrenal pheochromocytoma.

The patient was discharged 12 days postoperatively after close maternal and neonatal surveillance, with regular monitoring of blood pressure and twice a day premixed insulin and self-monitoring of blood sugar. She was advised to attend ophthalmology follow-up for a lesion suggestive of retinal hemangioblastoma. Neurosurgical follow-up is required for the cerebellar hemangioblastomas, and she is currently asymptomatic.

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with hypertension during pregnancy and gdma2. Further investigations revealed a right-sided adrenal tumor of 66x59mm in size, suggestive of pheochromocytoma, which was removed by laparoscopic right adrenalectomy.

Follow-Up:

The patient is currently under close surveillance at the neurosurgical clinic with regular MRI. At 6 months, MRI did not show a significant increase in tumor size and she is asymptomatic.

Summary:

This 34-year-old mother of two presented with hypertension and gdma2 during her third pregnancy. The multidisciplinary team decided to proceed with an interval adrenalectomy after ultrasonic imaging showed a hyperechoic, hypervascular well-defined right suprarenal mass suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Her pheochromocytoma was removed by laparoscopic right adrenalectomy, and her cerebellar hemangioblastomas are managed conservatively.

Admission diagnosis: Giant Cell Arteritis with vasculitis of the abdominal aorta and both common iliac arteries

Hospital course:

The patient was diagnosed with Giant Cell Arteritis and found to have vasculitis of the abdominal aorta and both common iliac arteries upon admission. Treatment with methotrexate alone or in combination with leflunomide and cyclophosphamide was not effective, after which tocilizumab (TCZ) was initiated. Following two initial intravenous applications, it was switched to TCZ subcutaneously. Prednisolone was tapered to 5mg within 4 months without symptoms of relapse. However, the patient relapsed after 7 months, with cervical tenderness, signs of aortitis on MRI and vessel wall thickening of the carotid arteries, while on a daily prednisolone dose of 5mg. Hence, TCZ was switched back to TCZ intravenously, and the prednisolone dose was increased to 30mg with subsequent tapering. After three months, under a 10mg dose of prednisolone, wall thickening of the carotid arteries and aorta markedly decreased in color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) and MRI respectively. The patient remained in remission for 9 months, until tocilizumab was stopped in preparation for valve surgery due to progressive aortic regurgitation. The patient restarted tocilizumab four weeks after surgery and prednisolone dose increased to 20mg due to relapse (aortic histology, CRP).  

Discharge instructions:

1. Continue the current medication regimen and follow-up with the primary care physician or rheumatologist as scheduled.
2. Monitor for any signs or symptoms of relapse, such as cervical tenderness, and contact the treating physician if present.

History: The patient has a past medical history of diabetes mellitus.

Hospital Course: The patient presented with left-sided congestion and epistaxis which he attributed to seasonal allergies. A CT scan revealed abnormal soft tissue causing contiguous opacification of the left nasal cavity and sinuses. After a biopsy confirmed carcinoma, the patient underwent an endoscopic craniofacial resection of the sinonasal mass. The specimen was received as multiple fragments of pink-purple ragged soft tissue measuring 3.5 cm in aggregate. Microscopic examination revealed a low-grade sinonasal non-ITAC consisting of a mixture of back-to-back glands, anastomosing cords, and solid areas with squamoid morular metaplasia. Immunohistochemical stains showed that the tumor cells were positive for CK7 in the areas of glandular morphology, and they were negative for CK20, SOX10, CK5/6, p40, p63, and DOG1. CDX2 showed focal weak nuclear staining exclusively within the squamoid morules, and β-catenin likewise showed nuclear staining restricted to squamoid morules with membranous staining throughout the rest of the tumor. Next-generation sequencing identified a missense mutation (S37C) in CTNNB1, the gene encoding β-catenin. The patient received postoperative radiotherapy and has no evidence of disease at 10 months after surgery.

Discharge Diagnosis: Asian variant of intravascular lymphoma with clinicopathological diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis

Hospital Course:
A 72-year-old male with no hematologic disease history was admitted to the hospital due to the presence of submental tumors without B symptoms. Laboratory tests revealed normal blood cell counts, negative atypical cells in the peripheral blood, and normal levels of lactate dehydrogenase. However, the soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels were elevated. CT scans showed tumorous masses in the nasal cavities and the paranasal sinuses, submental masses, and enlarged multiple jugular lymph nodes. PET/CT scans showed an abnormal uptake of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).

A biopsy was performed and the histology showed diffuse infiltration of large lymphoid cells with centroblast-like or immunoblast-like features. After 8 cycles of R-THPCOP, complete remission was achieved. However, 8 months after the first chemotherapy administration, local recurrences occurred. The patient was then given 4 cycles of the DeVIC regimen as salvage therapy.

Although abnormal 18F-FDG uptake on PET/CT disappeared after the second round of therapy, the patient experienced respiratory disturbance, fever, and general fatigue without lymph node swelling. CT scans showed splenomegaly but no tumorous lesion anywhere in the body. A random skin biopsy was performed, which revealed atypical large lymphoid cells within the lumens of the small blood vessels. The histological diagnosis was the Asian variant of intravascular lymphoma. According to the Filipovich et al criteria, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis was clinicopathologically diagnosed. The patient died 3 weeks after the recurrence was diagnosed.

Patient-1 was a 40-year-old male who presented with sudden chest pain and shortness of breath. He had a 20-year history of smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol. The patient previously underwent an operation and medicinal treatment as a result of tuberculous pleurisy. Chest X-rays showed an enlarged cardiac shadow, and an abnormal cardio-thoracic ratio, while an electrocardiogram detected a right bundle branch block and ST-T abnormalities. Transthoracic echocardiogram revealed pericardial effusion, space-occupying lesions, and an obstruction in the RV outflow tract with a round mass approximately 10 × 5.5 cm2 in size. A full-body computed tomographic and abdominal ultrasound examination excluded tumors in other organs. The patient underwent surgical resection but ultimately died 2 months post-surgery due to a tumor recurrence.

Pathology results revealed that the patient had a primary cardiac malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) in the RV. The tumor and adjacent tissue samples were sent to different medical facilities for evaluation, and the diagnostic report showed a positive reaction for Vimentin(+), CK(+), and WT-1(+) and negative reaction for MyoD-1(−), CD31(−), CD34(−), Desmin(−), SMA(−), S100(−), MSA(−), EMA(−), Myogenin(−), CK5/6(−), HBME-1(−), and PGM-1(−). The cells contained many multinuclear cells and abnormal nuclei.

The patient had a family history of malignant tumors diagnosed in three siblings of Patient-1's parents and another sibling who died of an unknown cause.

During the course of the patient's hospitalization, he received heparin anticoagulation prior to surgery, and peripheral blood samples were taken for this purpose.

In summary, the patient was a 40-year-old male with a significant smoking and alcohol history, who presented with sudden chest pain and shortness of breath, and was ultimately diagnosed with a primary cardiac malignant fibrous histiocytoma in the RV with tumor recurrence 2 months post-surgery leading to death.",,,0

The patient, a 60-year-old female with a right breast neoplasm, was admitted to the Radiology Department for a thoraco-abdominal CT scan. During the imaging process, a well-marginated, 3 cm in diameter, enhancing mass was discovered at the level of the left upper abdominal quadrant, between the spleen and the diaphragm. The lesion was initially thought to be an accessory spleen, but metastatic nodule could not be entirely excluded. Further examination of previous thoracic CT scans revealed that the nodule was already present, but located anterior to the lower pole of the spleen, between the greater curvature of the stomach and the upper left colon. The thin slices of the last oncological CT confirmed that the small mass was fed by an 18 cm-long thin vascular pedicle connected to the splenic vessels, indicative of a “Jokari sign”. The diagnosis provided shows the patient's case is a WAS.

Hospital Course:

A 60-year-old Persian man was admitted to our clinic with a chief complaint of headache and progressive bitemporal hemianopia. The patient had a medical history of non-functional pituitary macroadenoma that was resolved with transsphenoidal surgery 11 years ago. The patient also had a total thyroidectomy due to MTC, mild hypertension, and asymptomatic kidney stone. Further assessment revealed lymphadenopathy in the left cervical chain. The patient underwent brain MRI that demonstrated a solid tumor of sella turcica with suprasellar extension and involvement of the adjacent optic chiasm and cavernous sinuses. The patient underwent adenoma resection through a non-complicated TSS, which resolved the symptoms.

Subsequent assessments were done to evaluate the coexistence of MEN syndromes, and metabolites of cathecholamines, genetic testing for RET proto-oncogene mutation, and levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone were all normal. A neck ultrasonography was done due to the detected lymphadenopathy in the physical examination, which revealed a 15 × 7 mm lymph node suggestive of a metastatic lymph node and a 6 mm hypoechoic nodule in the left thyroid bed, which might be attributed to the thyroid gland remnant or local recurrence of MTC.

After undergoing cervical lymph node dissection and surgical removal of the nodule, the histopathologic examination established MTC metastatic lymph node and recurrence of MTC in the patient.

Patient Information:
- Name: [To be determined]
- Age: 35 years
- Gender: Male
- Diagnosis: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, blast phase

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital with fever and severe pain in both knees and ankles. A physical examination showed symmetrical oligoarthritis in his knees and ankles. A synovial fluid analysis of his right knee showed a clear, colorless fluid with an absence of crystals and a synovial fluid culture and hemoculture yielded no growth. A bone scintigraphy revealed a symmetrical blood flow to both ankles. A symmetrical soft-tissue uptake at the knees and ankles, with a prominent early bone uptake. And a symmetrical increased uptake at the mandible, bilateral proximal humeri, both elbows, both forearms, the bilateral femoral heads, the trochanteric region of both femora, the left femoral shaft, the distal femora, the proximal tibiae, the bilateral tibial shafts, and both distal tibiae, all of which favored a bone marrow expansion which might have been related to a leukemic infiltration. Testing for mutations in the BCR-ABL gene showed a negative result. A bone marrow aspiration revealed 10% myeloblasts.

Treatment:
The patient was prescribed with induction therapy with a 7 + 3 induction regimen (200 mg of cytarabine administered intravenously on days 1–7, plus 15 mg of idarubicin administered intravenously on days 1–3). Before switching to 140 mg of dasatinib, he received 600 mg of imatinib once daily. Following the treatment, his clinical symptoms, including joint pain and fever, improved, and he achieved a complete hematological remission, confirmed by a bone marrow study, 4 weeks after the induction therapy.

Medical Condition:
Unfortunately, he developed dyspnea on exertion after dasatinib treatment for a month, and pleural effusion with pulmonary hypertension was suspected from the dasatinib. Therefore, the decision was made to permanently stop administering the medication. A month later, he presented to our hospital with severe headaches of one week's duration, a low-grade fever, nausea, vomiting, and polyuria. A bone marrow aspiration showed multiple stages of the myeloid series with 7% myeloblasts. He received treatments with intravenously administered hydration (200 mL/hour of 0.9% normal saline), calcitonin (300 μg administered intravenously every 6 hours for 3 days), and imatinib (600 mg/day). However, as there was a minimal response in his high serum calcium level, 20 mg/day of intravenously administered dexamethasone was added on day 8 of admission. His severe headache symptom improved gradually, and the serum calcium level decreased dramatically to the normal range within a few days. He was then discharged with a serum calcium level of 7.6 mg/dL on day 15 of admission.

Hospital Course Summary:
A 35-year-old male was admitted to our hospital diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase. He was treated with imatinib, and his treatment response was monitored with an RQ-PCR. After achieving optimal response, he was unfortunately admitted again with joint-related complications and diagnosed with CML blast phase. The patient received induction therapy and multiple medications, resulting in an improvement of his symptoms. However, after a month, he was admitted again with different symptoms, treated again, and eventually discharged. He was later lost to follow-up and died at home.",,,0

Admission Diagnosis: Simple febrile seizure and eczema herpeticum

Hospital Course:
The patient was a 3-year-old Malay boy who initially presented with fever and an episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizure. He was diagnosed with simple febrile seizure and eczema herpeticum upon admission. The patient’s physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, maculopapular rashes with scaly and crusted areas, and “shotty” cervical lymph nodes. Laboratory findings showed hypochromic microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia with a peripheral blood smear significant for fragmented red cells, spherocytes, and polychromasia in keeping with MAHA. The patient was observed without intervention prior to the results of ADAMTS13 assay.

Subsequently, the ADAMTS13 assay results showed zero activities and a markedly high level of ADAMTS13 inhibitor, 93.15 U/mL (negative < 12 U/mL; borderline 12–15 U/mL; positive > 15 U/mL), confirming the diagnosis of secondary TTP. The screening for autoimmune disease showed anti-nuclear antibody positive and borderline double-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), however, complement 3 and complement 4 levels were normal. He received fresh frozen plasma (FFP) transfusions for 3 consecutive days, and subsequently, the counts recovered. A repeated ADAMTS13 activity at the end of the prednisolone course was >114%.

Discharge Diagnosis: Secondary TTP
Discharge Plan:
The patient’s TTP has been successfully treated with FFP transfusions and prednisolone. His ADAMTS13 activity had normalized to 48% at 12 months, and the ADAMTS13 inhibitor level was still detectable at 17.5 U/mL. Therefore, he is scheduled for follow-up every 3 months with surveillance of ADAMTS13 assay for 1 year. During his clinic follow-up at 6 months after treatment, he remained in remission, and his full blood counts were normal. 

The patient was discharged in good condition with the advisory to return to the hospital or seek medical attention immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise. The patient's parents were also appropriately advised to keep the patient’s vaccine status up to date.

The patient, an elderly male, was admitted to the oncodermatology clinic with a history of recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the left temple with zygomatic bone metastasis. The patient had undergone Mohs micrographic surgery and received two rounds of adjuvant radiotherapy. However, the patient’s condition continued to deteriorate and he was referred to our clinic for evaluation.

Diagnostic Assessment
The patient presented with a 3-week history of a rapidly enlarging painful nodule over his left zygoma. Repeat MRI showed continued tumor progression, with involvement of muscle, nerve, and bone. Tumor genomic analysis revealed a somatic missense (R135C) mutation in the ERBB3/HER3 gene, as well as multiple other mutations and a high tumor mutation burden.

Therapeutic Intervention
Therapy with 1,250 mg of lapatinib daily in combination with 240 mg nivolumab every 2 weeks was initiated to target the ERBB3/HER3 mutation. Additional tumor debulking in conjunction with cryotherapy to the base of the lesion was performed by our Mohs surgeon. Significant improvement in the clinical size of the lesion was noted after 2 months of lapatinib therapy. After 6 months, there was continued clinical improvement and MRI showed significant regression of muscle, nerve, and bone involvement. The patient experienced a significant decrease in narcotic pain medication dependence and improvement in hearing of the ipsilateral ear. Other than fatigue, he experienced no side effects from this therapy.

This 19-year-old Chinese woman was admitted to our institution with a diagnosis of monostotic fibrous dysplasia (FD) of her femoral neck. She presented with left hip pain that occurred during university basketball training. X-rays of the area revealed a ground glass lesion in her left femoral neck, which is a classic sign of FD. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed that the lesion was 10 cm in length. She was managed conservatively for 6 months but opted for surgical treatment due to persistent pain and the desire to prevent future fractures. She underwent surgery in July 2016 to augment her left femoral neck with an autologous cortical, free fibula bone graft. No screws or plates were used, and the defect in the fibula was filled with β-tricalcium phosphate. Samples of the tissue were sent for histological analysis, which confirmed the diagnosis of FD. She was discharged with non-weight bearing (NWB) on crutches on postoperative day 7.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of typical chest pain. On admission, the physical examination and initial electrocardiogram were unremarkable, and cardiac enzymes were negative. However, the patient was started on aspirin, statin, and nitroglycerin for the chest pain.

Cardiology was consulted, and they decided to do left heart catheterization and echocardiography to evaluate the patient's condition. The echocardiogram showed a normal ejection fraction with no wall motion abnormalities. Left heart catheterization showed anomalous coronaries, with all three coronaries arising from the right coronary cusp with a separate ostium. The left anterior descending artery had an anomalous origin with a separate ostium from the right coronary cusp. There was focal moderate to severe 70%-80% disease in the mid vessel. The left circumflex artery had an anomalous origin with a separate ostium from the right coronary cusp, and mild luminal irregularities were present. The right coronary artery was a large dominant vessel with mild luminal irregularities.

Admitting Diagnosis: Metastatic breast carcinoma to the left external auditory canal (EAC)

Course of Hospitalization:

The patient, a 53-year-old female, was admitted to our hospital with a history of swelling in her left EAC for 2 weeks and gradually worsening hearing loss. The patient had been diagnosed with invasive ductal breast carcinoma 4 years prior, which was initially treated with a radical mastectomy and followed by chemoradiotherapy. In the follow-up period, the patient had developed bone and lung metastases and relevant treatment was administered.

On physical examination, a soft tissue mass was observed that completely obstructed the left EAC. No neurologic symptoms were observed. A CT scan of the temporal bone was performed, which revealed that the left EAC had been completely obstructed by a soft tissue density mass. Despite the fact that the mass was located in both bony and cartilaginous EAC, no bony or cartilaginous invasion was observed. MRI showed a well-defined and fusiform soft tissue mass that filled the left EAC and was located in both the bony and cartilaginous EAC. Following the administration of the gadolinium-based contrast agent, homogeneous enhancement was seen. DWI showed slightly hyperintense signal on isotropic trace image and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map revealed slightly restricted diffusion in the mass. There was a small, non-enhancing hemorrhagic fluid collection present between the mass and the tympanic membrane. Middle and internal ear structures were normal on both MRI and temporal CT images. Based on the patient's history and imaging results, the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma to the left EAC was made.

The patient underwent surgical operation by the ENT surgeon and the mass was subtotally removed. Histopathologic examination of specimens revealed metastatic carcinoma that had the same histopathologic features as the primary breast carcinoma. Histopathological findings of the excised lesion showed microscopically a infiltrative carcinoma compatible with a breast origin based on immunohistochemical study results that were positive for Estrogen Receptor (ER), Cytokeratin 7, and E-cadherin but negative for C-Erb-b2 and Progesterone receptor (PR). The tumor was composed of atypical cells with large nuclei and prominent nucleoli in a solid pattern. There was no ductal or tubular structure. The positivity of both ER and E-Cadherin also supported ductal type when compared to lobular carcinoma of the breast.

The patient was discharged with appropriate referrals for further treatment follow-up. The patient's condition was stable upon discharge.

The 4-year-old male patient was admitted to the pediatric department due to newly occurred hypertension, which was a result of his right heminephrectomy of neuroblastoma. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scan revealed renal artery severe stenosis and right kidney atrophy. Due to refractory hypertension, he underwent Transcatheter Arterial Embolization of the right renal artery four days ago. Subsequently, the patient was stable until five hours before admission to the ICU when he developed anxiety, became breathless, and spitted frothy sputum. The patient suffered an episode of cardiac arrest, which was followed by intubation and 20 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), leading to restoration of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). 

Following CPR, the patient was treated with cortisone as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) was suspected. After treatment, the patient was transferred to the ICU for respiratory support and further treatment. On admission, the patient had high heart rate and blood pressure. A lot of flesh-colored aqueous sputum was identified from the endotracheal tube. The tidal volume was lower than normal on invasive ventilation with PI and PEEP. Due to the stiff lung, manual ventilation with balloon and sputum suction were performed constantly for one hour. The arterial blood analysis showed low pH level, low PO2, low PCO2, high lactate, and high BE. The FiO2 was 100%, and there was no urine output in the first hour.

Admission Diagnosis:
Stage IV squamous NSCLC

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of stage IV squamous NSCLC. He underwent definitive radiation therapy to the right upper lung lobe with chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin and paclitaxel combination for 6 weeks, with a positive response to therapy. However, after 9 months, his lung nodules were noted to be progressively enlarging, and two additional nodules were identified, concerning for new metastases. He was started on nivolumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, at a dose of 3 mg/kg infused every 2 weeks.

During the course of treatment with nivolumab, after six cycles, he developed a widespread pruritic eruption involving the chest, back, extremities, and penis. Upon examination, he was found to have numerous pink to pink-brown thin papules and plaques on the chest, abdomen, back, arms, legs, and penile shaft, some of which had an erythematous base. He also developed a shallow ulceration of the left lateral tongue. A biopsy of a characteristic lesion on the left upper arm was performed, which showed a lichenoid mucocutaneous eruption due to nivolumab.

Treatment was initiated with triamcinolone 0.1% ointment to the body, clobetasol 0.05% ointment to the penis, and clobetasol 0.05% gel to the tongue twice daily. Oral prednisone taper starting at 80 mg daily for 5 weeks was also started and nivolumab treatment was held for 1 week. After the completion of the oral steroid taper, his rash had significantly improved, and the penile erosions and oral ulceration had completely resolved despite resuming nivolumab therapy. However, 6 days after discontinuing prednisone, the rash recurred on the chest and back, requiring a second prednisone taper.

The patient received narrowband UVB phototherapy three times per week as an adjunct therapy. A maintenance dose of 5 mg daily prednisone was used for control of rash and pruritus. After ~70 NBUVB treatments, a slow prednisone taper with oral hydroxyzine was initiated. The patient elected to stop NBUVB treatments and has remained on 4 mg daily prednisone to date.

Admitting Diagnosis: Peripheral giant cell granuloma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our department with a complaint of pain in the left posterior mandible, associated with periodontal hyperplasia of the left mandibular second molar. The patient had also been experiencing ongoing pain for two months and spontaneous hemorrhage within the lesion region. On examination, the patient showed no visible swelling, tenderness, or pus discharge, but intraoral examination showed hyperplasic gingival tissue around the second molar. The panoramic radiograph showed irregular margins located at the periapical area, which led to a serious mobility of the mandibular left second molar.

After conducting a thorough clinical and radiographical examination, an incisional biopsy was performed under local anesthesia, which led to the diagnosis of peripheral giant cell granuloma (PGCG). A second surgery was performed under local anesthesia one week later, involving extraction of the tooth and a wide curettage of the lesion in the left posterior mandible. Pathological assessment of the second biopsy revealed a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Further investigations were done, and it was revealed that the patient potentially had DLBCL in other anatomical sites, such as the thyroid gland, gastric system, and prostate.

The patient was relieved and healing was uneventful. However, several consultations and investigations were undertaken. Whole body PET/CT scan was conducted, and based on the results, the patient underwent systemic chemotherapy as further treatment protocol of DLBCL.

The patient, a 69-year-old male, was admitted to our hospital with the chief complaints of a growing mass on his nose, concomitant nasal airway obstruction, visual field impairment, and an inability to wear glasses. Upon physical examination, the patient was found to have a rhinophyma measuring 6.7 centimeters in diameter, with nodular tumors, telangiectasia, and sebum inspissation. The glabellar lesion measured 3.0 cm in diameter and appeared as a discrete erythematous tumor with central ulceration and necrosis, suggesting non-rhinophymatous lesion and raising suspicion for malignancy. An additional 1.5 cm lesion of the right forehead region appeared as a round, telangiectatic nodule with a waxy border. A preoperative diagnosis of basal cell carcinoma for this separate lesion was confirmed by the pathological report. Surgery was performed on the nasal lesions, and the rhinophyma was excised and debulked, then closed with adjacent cheek flaps, while the glabellar lesion was treated with wide local excision and closed with forehead flaps. Frozen section analysis of the glabellar specimen revealed a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. 

Postoperatively, the patient was closely monitored, and after three weeks, the basal cell carcinoma of the right forehead was removed, and closure was accomplished with double opposing V-Y advancement flaps. The final pathology report confirmed the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with BCL6 positivity.

Diagnosis:
The patient presented with a large, painful perineal protrusion that was found to be a hydrocolpos secondary to an imperforate hymen. This was confirmed by physical exam, blood work, and computed tomography (CT). The remainder of the hymen was removed endoscopically. The patient's symptoms of dysuria, pollakiuria, and perineal swelling resolved after the procedure.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a vaginal exam which revealed a large, thin-walled, fluctuant structure filling the vaginal lumen. The structure was perforated and drained of approximately 200 mL of brown, mucoid fluid. No bacteria were seen on cytology, and no organisms were cultured from the fluid. A sample was collected for cytology and culture. Vaginoscopy revealed remnants of an imperforate hymen just cranial to the external urethral orifice. The remainder of the hymen was removed endoscopically with grasping forceps and submitted for histopathology. The patient was discharged with instructions to complete the previously prescribed course of marbofloxacin.

Condition at Discharge:

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of progressing pain in his right knee in May 2017. He had no previous history of trauma, and it was found that he did not have any comorbidities. Physical examination showed diffuse pain over the medial and lateral joint spaces. The Zohlen sign was positive, and collateral and cruciate ligaments were stable. Anteroposterior and lateral radiographs of the knee demonstrated a mild osteoarthritis (grade II according to Kellgren and Lawrence) with a large cystic lesion of the lateral femoral condyle. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, and it demonstrated a cystic lesion with hypointensity on T1-weighted and hyperintensity on T2-weighted images. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a simple, solitary bone cyst without any signs of malignancy or rheumatic disease. The patient was advised to undergo a total knee replacement, following which a complete curettage of the lesion was carried out with filling using a synthetic resorbable bone graft substitute (Cerament).

Four months later, the patient returned to the hospital with clinical signs of arthrofibrosis, which was diagnosed as grade 2 with >20 fibroblasts/high-power field with no evidence of a third-body wear or granulocytes. Revision surgery and an open arthrolysis to treat the arthrofibrosis were carried out, after which continuous passive motion therapy was administered immediately at the site of a femoral nerve block during the first 5 postoperative days. The patient was discharged approximately 9 days later, with the postoperative course remaining uneventful.

The patient returned on subsequent follow-up visits, exhibiting good osseointegration of Cerament and excellent extension/flexion range of motion (0–0–100°) remaining the same over a follow-up period of 12 months.

Patient Information: The patient is a 53-year-old African-American female with a history of uterine fibroids.

Hospital Course: The patient presented with a two-month history of nausea, vomiting, nervousness, weight gain, and left lower quadrant abdominal pain. Physical examination revealed a soft, non-distended abdomen with pain upon deep palpation localized to the left lower quadrant. She was found to have a bilaterally enlarged thyroid gland consistent with a goiter and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. The patient was started on antithyroid medications. Additionally, an abdominal CT scan showed an enlarged uterus along with fibroids, a hemorrhagic cyst of the right ovary, and a teratoma of the left ovary. Beta-hCG intact levels were measured twice, showing a value greater than 450,000mIU/mL. The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Tissue diagnosis confirmed the ovarian teratoma with sections of the myometrial wall containing massive hydropic chorionic villi. It was consistent with the presentation of a complete hydatidiform mole. The patient underwent chemotherapy and monitored for gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Post-surgical management included thyroid hormone level monitoring and continued low-dose methimazole. The patient reported no symptoms and had a normal thyroid hormone level one month following surgery. The patient has sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic and the results are negative. The methimazole was then discontinued.

The 35-year-old male patient was admitted with a right distal tibial non-union, which had developed into varus deformity after sustaining a high-energy, multifragmentary compound fracture 4 months earlier. The patient was treated with a below-knee, weight-bearing Sarmiento cast which was later replaced by a retrograde expandable nail. The non-union was successfully treated, and the patient had uneventfully returned to work. However, 9 months later, there were signs of calcaneal resorption around the nail, which warranted its removal. The first attempt to remove the nail failed when it fractured at the junction between the valve and metal fins. Subsequent attempts using various methods like grabbers and mole wrench were unsuccessful. The nail was later removed piecemeal through a tibial window with a burr. The patient's tibia was protected in a below-knee walking cast for 6 weeks, and the patient had an uneventful recovery.

Diagnosis:
Intramural ectopic gestational sac in the second trimester with placenta previa

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics for termination of pregnancy due to an asymptomatic condition. She had a history of curettage and her last menstrual period was 17 weeks and 2 days ago. An abdominal ultrasound showed a gestational sac at a distance from the cavity, with a compressed myometrium between the two of them. A clear fetus with organs and placenta previa was also detected through an MRI. The GS was embedded into the myometrium and not connected with the uterine cavity and endometrium. A linear hypointensity was observed between the GS and uterine cavity.

Treatment:
Surgical exploration of the abdomen was conducted under temporary balloon occlusion of the abdominal aorta to reduce blood loss. The balloon was placed between the opening of renal artery and iliac artery before the operation. The intramural ectopic GS in the second trimester was successfully excluded without life-threatening hemorrhage. Hysteroplasty was performed instead of hysterectomy considering the age of the patient.

Outcome:
The patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged 6 days after the surgery. Her β-hCG titre decreased to 1727 mIU ml–1 on the second day post-operation and decreased further to 440.1 mIU ml–1 on the sixth day.

Admitting Diagnosis: Asthenia and weight loss
Final Diagnosis: Pediatric-onset adult sarcoidosis with liver, splenic, and abdominal lymphadenopathy and mild pulmonary fibrosis

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the general pediatrician with complaints of asthenia and weight loss in the previous month. Physical examination revealed hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal lymphadenopathy, and a hypo-echogenic solid neoformation in front of the celiac artery. She was subsequently admitted to the Department of Pediatrics of the Meyer Children’s Hospital for further diagnostic investigations.

Initial laboratory tests found microcytic iron deficiency anemia, and Chest X-ray was negative. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination of the superior and inferior abdomen with contrast medium confirmed increased liver dimensions and its structural inhomogeneity with zones of signal alteration. Suspecting a systemic lymphoproliferative disease, we performed liver and lymph node ultrasound-guided biopsy, which showed non-necrotizing granulomatous inflammation, resembling sarcoidosis, and aspects of non-specific inflammation of the liver.

During hospitalization, the patient's condition remained good, and she exhibited no signs of fever. Considering lymph node hypertrophy and the signs of initial portal hypertension, we started therapy with prednisone 40 mg/day and subsequent cross-therapy with mycophenolate mofetil. The patient came back to our attention a month after discharge for a follow-up visit, where she was found to be in good general condition, with hepatomegaly and without other clinical signs or symptoms. A brain MRI was performed in order to rule out cerebral involvement and it revealed normal findings. One year later, she maintained good clinical condition and normal laboratory tests, and MMF was gradually reduced and definitively suspended after 18 months.

Follow-up Plan:
The patient will have periodic follow-up visits, consisting of clinical and laboratory evaluation every 6 months and annual pulmonary function tests, unless clinical or laboratory new findings.

Hospital Course:
A 63-year-old woman of Greek ancestry presented to our Retina Service with a complaint of decreased central vision OU. The patient had a medical history of sickle beta thalassemia and was receiving regular blood transfusions. She was also receiving iron-chelation treatment with DFO for the past 25 years. The patient did not have any peripheral, night or color vision problems. Her BCVA was 20/50 OU and IOP was normal. Fundus examination revealed the presence of a yellow-brown macular lesion OU. Fundus autofluorescence revealed hyperfluorescent areas in a butterfly-shaped pattern corresponding to the pigment clumping areas seen in fundoscopy OU. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a large hypofluorescent, butterfly-shaped macular lesion surrounded by areas of focal hyperfluorescence OU. Humphrey visual field perimetry was within normal limits.

Plan and Outcome:
The haematologists consulted regarding DFO discontinuation decided to continue chelation therapy because the risks pertaining to the patient's underlying disease outweighed the risk of possible visual loss. The patient was followed up closely every three months during a 4-year follow-up period. BCVA remained stable without any signs of anatomic change as demonstrated with repeated OCT examinations.

Patient Name: Not specified
Age: 71
Sex: Female

Reason for Hospitalization:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to acute on chronic kidney injury, generalized weakness, vomiting, and diarrhea. Thrombocytopenia and anemia were also noted.

Hospital Course:
The patient was diagnosed with kappa light chain multiple myeloma with extensive lytic lesions in bones and renal dysfunction. Ixazomib was started at a dose of 3 mg on days 1, 8, and 15 along with lenalidomide and dexamethasone but was held on admission due to significant vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. After admission, the patient developed acute thrombocytopenia, Coomb's negative hemolytic anemia with profound schistocytes, and acute renal injury, which raised the concern for TMA. Fresh frozen plasma was administered, and plasmapheresis was performed. However, plasmapheresis was stopped after 5 days due to lack of clinical improvement and negative workup for TTP. The patient improved spontaneously with supportive management, and the gradual and spontaneous improvement in the platelet count pointed suspicion away from malignancy-induced TMA and favored DTMA caused by cumulative toxicity of ixazomib, likely precipitated by acute renal dysfunction and hypoproteinemia from malnutrition and chronic diarrhea related to ixazomib side effect. The patient was subsequently discharged after improvement.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with ixazomib-induced DTMA from cumulative toxicity.

Condition at Discharge:
The patient's condition improved significantly, and she was discharged in stable condition with close follow-up needed.

Follow-up:
Close follow-up is recommended to monitor the patient's progress and prevent recurrence of TMA. In addition, further management of myeloma with consideration for alternative therapies should be pursued.

The 59-year-old male patient had presented with nausea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. He had previously been diagnosed with a stage T1A nonsmall cell lung cancer in the right upper lobe. The patient had refused surgery and completed Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT). Serial surveillance imaging showed no abnormalities until the current presentation. 

Diagnostic Assessment:

A total body PET-CT scan was ordered due to the patient's prior history of cancer. The results showed thickening of the wall of the gastric fundus and a mass in the tail of the pancreas. Additionally, a 1.1-cm filling defect within the splenic vein was observed. Upper endoscopy revealed a 5-cm infiltrative and ulcerated mass in the gastric fundus. Gastric biopsies showed poorly differentiated carcinoma. EUS confirmed a hypoechoic round mass in the pancreas with local vascular involvement and splenic vein thrombus and was diagnosed with neuroendocrine carcinoma.

Treatment:

Treatment options, including palliative care, were discussed with the patient and his family, and the patient elected to receive symptomatic treatment.

Conclusion:

Metastasis of the primary lung tumor to the stomach is infrequent and sporadic. Symptomatic cases present with epigastric pain, chronic anemia, signs of GI bleed (hematemesis, melena), and gastric perforations. The patient's case illustrates the potential for cancer to spread via hematogenous and lymphatic routes.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for blunt chest and abdominal trauma after a motorcycle accident. On admission, he had a Glasgow Coma scale score of 15 and was hemodynamically stable. Imaging studies revealed nonspecific wall thickening of the proximal jejunum and trace pneumoperitoneum with no evidence of extravasation of oral contrast.

Based on the presence of pneumoperitoneum in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma, the patient was taken to the operating room. During exploratory laparotomy, no evidence of bowel perforation was found, and a segmental section of the diseased portion of the colon was taken and sent to pathology.

Pathology results revealed multiple enlarged cystic nodules ranging from 0.5 to 3 cm in the bowel wall. Radiologic studies were reviewed by a panel of abdominal radiologists, who suggested that the proximity of the pneumoperitoneum to the pneumatosis cystoides intestinalis suggested that the pneumoperitoneum may have been caused by incidental atraumatic or traumatic rupture of the cysts, but they could not rule out bowel perforation based on imaging alone.

The patient had an uncomplicated postoperative course and was transferred to an acute care facility of equal acuity for further medical management as per the patient’s health insurance request.

Patient: Male, 67 years old

Condition: Squamous cell carcinoma of lower gingiva

Hospital Course:

During the flap harvesting emergency, there was a shortage of flap tissue volume. Subsequently, the tumor violated the facial skin. Upon removing the violated facial skin, the skin paddle was used to repair the facial defect and act as an extraoral ""window"" to monitor flap survival. The FHL was used to repair the intraoral defect, and an artificial biological membrane and an iodoform cotton wrapping were used in case 1. Ten days after the surgery, the intraoral mucosa had recovered well, and the fibular flap survived without infection or necrosis. The patient expressed satisfaction with their appearance and oral functionality recovery.

Recommendations:

Further visits to the dentist for general dental care and oral hygiene practices are recommended. The patient should also schedule a follow-up appointment with their surgeon to monitor the recovery process. At home, the patient is advised to maintain good oral hygiene practices to reduce the risk of infection.

The patient, a 55-year-old woman with no significant medical history, presented to the emergency room with a 1-day history of abdominal pain and a thick turbid discharge from the left inguinal area. Examination revealed leukocytosis, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. Imaging studies revealed a microperforation of the sigmoid colon, abscess in the left lower quadrant, hepatic lesion, and bilateral hydronephrosis. Ultrasound demonstrated an intra-uterine device. There was a large, infiltrating heterogenous hyperattenuating mass invading the urinary bladder, left adnexa, sigmoid, left inguinal canal, and left pelvic wall area, which raised suspicion for malignancy. Due to suspected colon perforation and the enclosed mass in the small bowel, conservative treatment was initiated with parenteral antibiotics and fasting with total parental nutrition, while the imaging-guided percutaneous abscess drainage was performed.

After 10 days of conservative treatment, a repeat CT of the abdomen-pelvis showed improved abdominal abscess and liver lesion; however, no significant changes were detected in the conglomerated mass invading the pelvis. The patient developed mechanical small bowel obstruction requiring exploratory laparotomy, which revealed perforated colon, obstructive small bowel, and organs involved. Severe adhesion between the mass and pelvic organs, including the uterus, small and large bowels, and bladder was identified. Infection with Actinomyces species was confirmed on permanent histology.

Treatment:

En-bloc excision of the mass was performed using Hartmann’s procedure, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, small bowel resection, and appendectomy. The double J catheter was inserted into both the ureters without resection. The parenteral antibiotic regimen was changed to tigecycline, amikacin, metronidazole, and Penicillin G.

The patient was admitted with a complaint of left hip pain and a limp. The patient had a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia for 5 years and underwent radiation therapy of the total body and bone marrow transplantation at age 6. Since the onset of the disease, the patient had been receiving steroids. Three months post-transplantation, the patient developed lung disease secondary to graft- versus-host disease and received high doses of steroids. Subsequently, the patient developed autoimmune hemolytic anemia and was treated again with high doses of steroids. Physical examination revealed a small Cushingoid boy with severe loss of muscle bulk due to steroid-induced myopathy.

Radiographic evaluation of the spine and hips revealed compression fractures in the thoracic spine (T11, T12) and mild deformity of the femoral epiphyses. BMD was measured in the lumbar spine (L1-4) and proximal femur using DXA. Trabecular BMD was measured at the 4% distal radius using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). On the basis of established pediatric densitometric criteria, a diagnosis of low bone mineral content was made and patient was started on treatment with vitamin D and calcium.

Follow-up DXA studies to determine response to treatment at 12 months demonstrated collapse of the femoral head and an increase in BMD. Sequential follow-up DXA scans at 24 months showed further destruction of the femoral head and an increase in bone mass. Trabecular BMD at the 4% distal radial site by pQCT at 12 and 24 months showed a decrease. The concurrent visual assessment of the DXA images showed progressive deterioration of the left hip joint, beginning as vague osteosclerosis and becoming severe with destruction of the femoral head, suggesting the diagnosis of osteonecrosis.

The patient was discharged after recovery with a comprehensive care plan including management of osteonecrosis, vitamin D and calcium supplements, and regular follow-up appointments with the pediatrician and orthopedic surgeon.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our hospital due to severe vomiting. Upon screening at her workplace, she was diagnosed with hypertension and hyperglycemia but neglected these findings. She sought medical treatment for her condition at a local clinic but her symptoms persisted, and she was referred to our hospital. Upon physical examination, the patient's blood pressure was elevated and her laboratory tests revealed hypoalbuminemia, iron deficiency anemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart failure, and ovarian masses. 

The patient was diagnosed with ovarian endometriosis, and, to treat this condition, she received cyclic therapy using Gn-RH agonist, leuprolide acetate, or goserelin acetate via subcutaneous injection six times every four weeks for 24 weeks and DNG orally administered between 24 and 108 weeks. Regular medical examinations and ultrasonography were conducted every three months to monitor her condition. After approximately seven years of treatment, her ovarian tumors showed a partial response with a decrease in tumor marker levels.

However, after eight years of treatment, the patient reported lumbago and underwent careful medical evaluation, which indicated malignant transformation of the right ovarian tumor. She underwent multiple surgeries, including an abdominal total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingooophorectomy, and omentectomy. Pathological examination revealed clear cell carcinoma of the right ovary, endometriosis of the right ovary, left ovarian metastasis from right ovarian cancer, uterine infiltration from the right ovarian cancer, and infiltration of clear cell carcinoma to the tissue in front of the rectum.

Following the surgery, the patient received six courses of conventional TC, which included paclitaxel and carboplatin. After chemotherapy, positron emission tomography-computed tomography did not show any abnormal uptake of the malignancy.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for psychiatric observation in accordance with the Criminal Procedure Act No. 51 of 1977, as amended. A working diagnosis of schizophrenia was made due to the patient's severe psychotic state. The patient's evaluation was hindered by his inability to provide reliable background history. During the course of the patient's stay in the hospital, his psychotic symptoms did not improve significantly despite treatment with two different first-generation antipsychotics. His speech content became increasingly impoverished and he also experienced several tonic-clonic seizures. An EEG revealed excess diffuse low-voltage theta slow-wave activity, medium-voltage delta slow-wave activity in the frontal areas maximal on the left, and isolated sharp transients in the left frontal area indicative of localized left frontal dysfunction with possible epileptiform features. A computed tomography scan of the brain revealed a large left frontal mass lesion with cystic areas and a high density center containing calcium; a magnetic resonance imaging scan suggested the presence of a large, left frontal lobe, multicystic inhomogeneous tumor with characteristics consistent with a ganglioglioma or pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. The tumor was successfully resected and a diagnosis of a mature teratoma was made. The patient's family was located during the weeks following his surgery, revealing that they had lost contact with him several years prior, and he was discharged to their care with a referral letter for follow-up in their province of residence.

Medical History:
A 3-year-old male patient with intermittent lumbar pain and difficulty walking was admitted to our emergency department. The patient had an uneventful past medical history until 4 months earlier when he had a lumbar trauma. The patient visited an emergency care unit three months after the trauma due to increased lumbar pain and received oral therapy with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug for a week.

Hospital Course:
Ten days after discontinuation of oral therapy, the patient's lumbar pain worsened, which led to admission to our department. The patient underwent a physical examination, abdominal ultrasonography, and laboratory blood tests, which were normal or only slightly abnormal. The ESR, CRP and procalcitonin were slightly abnormal, but the patient's WBC count was normal. An MRI scan of the spine showed a T1 post-enhancement had increased the signal of the anulus L3–L4 of the adjacent soft tissue, suggesting an infective SD. The patient was started on broad-spectrum, anti-infective intravenous therapy with piperacillin–tazobactam and vancomycin and oral anti-inflammatory therapy.

The patient responded well to the therapy and experienced a rapid clinical improvement. After 4 weeks of therapy, a second MRI was performed, which showed no significant radiological changes. The therapy was modified, and the patient remained on antibiotic therapy for 16 weeks in total. Immunological exams were normal, and no causative infectious agent was documented. The therapy was well-tolerated, and the patient did not experience any side effects.

Follow-up:
During a 3-year follow-up, the patient experienced only one episode of back pain, which promptly resolved. The patient underwent an MRI, which ruled out the possibility of a reactivation of the infection. No lumbar pain was reported after the episode, and the patient maintained normal life.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with infective SD.

Summary:
The 3-year-old male patient was admitted to our department with intermittent lumbar pain and difficulty walking. The patient had sustained a lumbar trauma 4 months earlier but was not investigated at that time. The patient was diagnosed with an infective SD and responded well to antibiotic therapy.

Admitting Diagnosis: Nonspecific abdominal symptoms

Principal Diagnosis: Neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 71-year-old male with a history of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, initially presented to our emergency department with nonspecific abdominal symptoms consistent with bloating and a feeling of abdominal enlargement. He had no history of neoplasms or previous abdominal examination. Following a computed tomography (CT) scan, the patient was referred to our clinic due to the detection of a tumor in the pancreatic head. On physical examination, the patient presented with a soft, non-tender abdomen without palpable masses, icterus, or lymphadenopathy. The patient’s vital signs, with the exception of some abnormal laboratory values, were within normal limits. An ultrasound and endoscopic ultrasound of the abdomen revealed a tumor in the area between the neck and body of the pancreas. A contrast-enhanced CT showed an almost 3 cm round, well-defined and homogeneous tumor in the same location. A biopsy, histopathological, and immunohistochemical examination confirmed the diagnosis of a well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. The patient underwent pancreas resection and a 68gallium-DOTATOC positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scan four months after the surgery did not show increased metabolic uptake.

Hospital Course:

On admission, the patient’s blood glucose was controlled with insulin glargine. On discharge, the patient’s most recent glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.7% and his diabetes medication was modified to a combination of insulin glargine, insulin glulisine, and metformin due to his elevated HbA1c reading.

Discharge Medications:

Insulin glargine, insulin glulisine, and metformin

Follow-up:

The patient was advised to follow up with his healthcare provider in 1 to 2 weeks to monitor any changes in his condition.

Summary:

Admitting Diagnosis: Fever and poor general condition

Brief Hospital Course: A nine-day-old male newborn was admitted to the hospital due to fever and poor general condition. He was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 at admission and developed respiratory failure and diarrhea with enterorrhagia, which led to PICU admission. He was supported with noninvasive ventilation and treated with antibiotic wide coverage. In the subsequent three days, his neurological condition deteriorated with impaired consciousness and pathological spontaneous motricity, leading to intubation and mechanical ventilation. The chest radiograph and CT scan showed a picture of bilateral interstitial pneumonia with an extensive area of atelectasis in the basal site. 

Diagnostic and Therapeutic Procedures: Nasopharyngeal swabs and bronchoalveolar lavage were performed to assess the SARS-CoV-2 viral load. SARS-CoV-2 variant determination was performed by SNP detection approach, suggesting VOC 202012/01 Lineage B.1.1.7 variant. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 hyperimmune plasma and medications like dexamethasone and remdesivir were administered. A lumbar puncture was performed, and the metabolic test on blood and liquor were normal. Immunological screening showed no abnormalities. The EEG showed hypovolted brain electrical activity with a discontinuous pattern. The cerebral CT scan was normal, but the brain MRI showed deep medullary vein thrombosis associated with cytotoxic edema in the deep periventricular white matter, which was treated with enoxaparin. Extended thrombophilic screening including homocysteine, anticardiolipin antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-beta-2-glycoprotein antibodies, protein S, protein C, activated protein C resistance, lupus anticoagulant, factor XIII, von Willebrand factor antigen, Factor V Leyden mutation, factor II prothrombin mutation, and MTHFR mutation were normal. 

Condition at Discharge: The patient's condition progressively improved, and after 13 days, he was extubated and in four more days became oxygen independent. At the five-month follow-up visit, the baby was doing well, without any clinical problems. The T1-weighted MRI showed significant reduction in linear hyperintense lesions, normal intensity of periventricular white matter, and enlargement of lateral ventricles.

Name: [patient name]
Age: 54 years old
Sex: Male
Medical History: Medically free

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with a gradual painless decrease in vision of his left eye over one year, accompanied by mild pain, photophobia, and redness from time to time. The patient underwent uneventful cataract surgery of both eyes 13 years prior to his presentation. On examination, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was measured as 20/28 in the right eye (OD) and 20/400 in the left eye (OS). Slit-lamp biomicroscopic examination of OD was unremarkable. However, examination of OS showed 1+ mixed anterior chamber cells and a relatively small CCC, along with a thick turbid greenish fluid behind the IOL. The fundus was poorly visualized. B-scan detected moderately dense vitreous opacities suggestive of vitritis, with no associated choroidal thickening. UBM detected a hyperechoic collection of turbid fluid behind the IOL with a distended capsular bag, confirming the presumed diagnosis of CBDS.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
Late-onset CBDS with a high possibility of associated P. acnes was assumed, and surgical intervention was considered. After explaining the surgical procedure and obtaining written informed consent from the patient, a pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with a posterior capsulotomy was performed. Initially, 23 gauge three PPV trocars were placed 3.5 mm away from the limbus. Intravitreal vancomycin (1 mg/0.1 mL) was injected at the end of the procedure due to the high possibility of associated P. acnes endophthalmitis. The aspirated material was sent to histopathology for gram stains and cultures. After 72 hours, Thioglycolate broth was positive for the growth of P. acnes confirming the presumed diagnosis.

Disposition and Follow-up:
The post-operative period was uneventful, and no signs of intraocular inflammation were detected. At six months, the patient had a 20/25 BCVA and did fine without any complaints. The patient was discharged from the clinic.",,,0
3054,"Hospital Course:
The patient, a 16 year-old Kenyan male, was admitted with severe aplastic anemia. He had previously sought care in India, where he received horse anti-thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine, which he was unresponsive to. The patient had multiple hospitalizations due to disease-related complications and had accumulated several risk factors for MDRO carriage including frequent antibiotic and healthcare exposure. Upon transfer to the NIH for enrollment in a research study involving a potential haplo-cord transplant, the patient arrived septic with vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus fecium and MDR E. coli-positive blood cultures.

Treatment:
The patient was initially treated with an antibiotic regimen that included daptomycin, imipenem, ceftazidime-avibactim, colistin and tigecycline. This combination was formulated to accommodate the differing antibiotic sensitivities among the gram-negative isolates. Following initiation of antibiotics, the patient's fever defervesced, his blood cultures cleared and his hemodynamic instability improved. However, a direct hyperbilirubinemia developed between Week 1 and Week 3 of admission, reaching a peak total bilirubin level of 26.3 mg/dl. There was concern for imipenem toxicity contributing to cholestasis, so the patient was trialed on a carbapenem-sparing regimen. 

Drug Combinations:
A “real-time” HTS combinational drug screen was performed to identify the most suitable alternative antibiotic combinations. Three MDROs were isolated from the patient on admission, all of which were multidrug-resistant. The drug combinations that were found to be effective included gentamicin+colistin+rifabutin, colistin+imipenem+rifabutin, meropenem+tigecycline+colistin, meropenem+tigecycline+colistin+ceftazidime, and meropenem+tigecycline+colistin+rifabutin. 

Outcome:
The patient's direct hyperbilirubinemia was ultimately ascribed to imipenem toxicity, and imipenem was discontinued and replaced with piperacillin-tazobactam plus gentamicin. Over the next 3 weeks, the total bilirubin levels steadily declined to 2.2 mg/dl, and the MDR E. coli and K. pneumoniae were controlled with negative blood cultures. The patient subsequently received a haplo-cord transplant but ultimately died 4 months after presentation due to disseminated infection with a resistant Scopulariopsis mold.",,,0

Final Diagnoses: Autosomal dominant pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (ADPHA1)

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 20-day-old female, was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit due to poor oral intake and lethargy. Physical examination revealed several physical anomalies, including both thumbs in palms, frontal bossing, prominent upper lip, high arched palate, sparse frontal scalp hair, and bilateral 5th finger clinodactyly. Initial laboratory results indicated severe metabolic acidosis and dehydration, which warranted immediate intravenous fluid therapy. Subsequent laboratory tests revealed hyponatremia and hyperkalemia, which were effectively corrected with intravenous fluid and oral sodium chloride supplementation. Targeted exome sequencing (TES) was performed, however, it was negative for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants. Further testing using chromosome microarray (CMA) identified a 203 kb heterozygous deletion at 4q31.23, which encompasses exons 7-9 of NR3C2 and exons 15-23 of the ARHGAP10 gene. This deletion confirmed a diagnosis of ADPHA1, with the haploinsufficiency of NR3C2 as the causative factor. The patient's clinical symptoms and biochemical results improved after supplemental therapy, including both oral sodium chloride and positive pressure ventilation.

She was found to have severe hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypomagnesemia with an ionized calcium level of 1.82 mmol/L and a serum PTH level of 3071.90 pg/mL. Further evaluation was done which revealed a suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism leading to a parathyroid scan. The scan showed a sestamibi-avid mass in the inferior pole of the right thyroid with calcification, which was highly suspicious for parathyroid carcinoma or adenoma, and a sestamibi-avid soft tissue mass in the lateral aspect of the 7th right rib, which was highly suspicious for metastasis. The patient was subsequently given corrective treatments for all her electrolyte imbalances.

The patient underwent total thyroidectomy in another institution two months post-discharge with the final histopathologic diagnosis revealing multiple pathologies including a favor for parathyroid carcinoma, lymphovascular space invasion seen, papillary microcarcinoma, and multinodular colloid goiter with hyperplastic features. Slide review done in our institution 7 months later showed an enlarged hypercellular parathyroid consistent with parathyroid carcinoma with extension beyond the capsule and encroaching on sizable extraglandular vessels. The patient was subsequently lost to follow-up.

She was re-admitted at our institution 7 months later due to alleged behavioral changes. Work-up revealed no electrolyte imbalances.

This hospital course summary documents the medical events that took place during the admission period of the patient. The patient was a 47-year-old male who presented to the emergency department with a complaint of generalized weakness and fatigue. The symptoms had developed over the course of two weeks and hindered the patient's ability to walk without assistance. The patient provided no history of chest pain, dyspnea, altered bowel habits, previous syncopal episodes, headaches, dizziness, or prior substance abuse.

The patient was started on a course of oral prednisone for bilateral anterior uveitis. In the course of evaluation, the patient was found to have severe hypotension and admitted to the medical floor. The patient was treated with intravenous fluids, norepinephrine, hydrocortisone, and tazobactam/piperacillin. Initial laboratory investigations showed an elevated total leukocyte count with neutrophilia. 

The patient underwent an extensive workup to determine the cause of his hypotension and generalized weakness. An initial diagnosis of septic shock was ruled out. The possibility of sarcoidosis was initially considered but ruled out due to the patient's quick deterioration and lack of response to corticosteroid therapy.

A presumptive diagnosis of Addison crisis was made due to the history of steroid use. The diagnosis was supported by inappropriately low cortisol levels and low ACTH levels. Further evaluation showed an enlarged right adrenal gland with a heterogeneous hyperdense area. A smaller heterogeneous lesion was present in the lateral limb of the left adrenal gland. A CT scan showed the presence of bilateral adrenal hemorrhage.

The patient did not present with classical features of adrenal insufficiency. Serum sodium and potassium levels were mildly low. Low ACTH could be attributed to prior prednisone therapy supplemented with hydrocortisone. A possibility of panhypopituitarism was ruled out, and euthyroid sick syndrome explained low TSH, T3, and T4 levels obtained when the patient was critically ill.

Some of the possible causes of adrenal hemorrhage were ruled out, including sepsis, antiphospholipid syndrome, abdominal trauma, and bleeding diathesis. No consensus was reached on the etiology of the adrenal hemorrhage.

The patient's condition worsened despite vigorous treatment, and he was transferred to the ICU and intubated. The patient subsequently developed bradycardia, which led to an asystolic rhythm. Despite performing CPR for 25 minutes, the patient could not be revived, and care was ultimately withdrawn.

In conclusion, this hospital course summary documents the evaluation and management of a patient with hypotension and generalized weakness. The patient's condition was complicated by bilateral adrenal hemorrhage, and a presumptive diagnosis of Addison crisis was made. The patient's condition deteriorated despite aggressive treatment, ultimately leading to cardiac arrest and withdrawal of care.",,,0

Hospital Course:

Admitted inpatient for surgical management of a right nipple lesion. The patient reports noticing a small yellow bump on her nipple two years prior and becoming concerned due to rapid growth in the last year. A shave biopsy four months prior suggested squamous cell carcinoma. On examination, the patient had a 2.2 cm lesion occupying the right nipple with erythematous and rigid breast along with yellow pus draining from the nipple. An MRI was ordered and revealed no underlying breast malignancy.

A wedge biopsy of the nipple was performed to confirm the initial shave biopsy pathology. Histopathology showed verrucous features with chronic inflammation and underlying abscess with some possibility of cutaneous malignancy and HPV L1 Capsid protein. Due to inadequate sample removal in the initial shave biopsy and positive margins, excision with wide margins was determined to be appropriate for removal of the lesion.

The patient underwent a wide excision of the right nipple-areola complex for removal of the growth without any complications. Following the surgery, the final histologic examination revealed a large tumor with verrucous and hyperkeratotic features, dyskeratosis, nests of keratin pearl formation along with microinvasion of the dermis and loss of basal lamina. However, no tumor cells were found in all margins.

The post-op course was uneventful. During the hospital stay, the patient was treated for an abscess with antibiotic therapy, and the patient's status improved. She was monitored for potential recurrence of the growth during the follow-up period.

Physical examination revealed a complete ptosis of the left eyelid and complete absence of extraocular movements of the left eye, which were referable to the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve. The patient was being treated for lung cancer that had spread to the liver and cerebellum. Head CT scan showed mucous thickening in the left sphenoid and maxillary sinuses. Brain MRI revealed a new expansive lesion in the left cavernous sinus, which was previously not there in a CT performed several weeks ago. The lesion was inseparable from T2-hypointense changes in the posterior part of the left sphenoid sinus.

The patient underwent endoscopic sinus surgery, which included removal of mucus and fungal debris confirmed as aspergilloma on pathologic examination. Additionally, a mycotic aneurysm of the intracavernous carotid artery from the spread of invasive aspergillosis from the adjacent sphenoid sinus was diagnosed in this patient. Time-of-flight MRA confirmed the presence of a saccular aneurysm of the cavernous portion of the left internal carotid artery, with evidence of turbulent flow within the aneurysm and with an expansion of the aneurysm towards the left side. 

The patient did not undergo endovascular treatment due to the presence of a single hemorrhagic metastasis in the right cerebellar hemisphere, contraindicating antiaggregative drugs. The multidisciplinary team made the decision to refrain from the treatment due to the dismal prognosis of the malignancy. 

The patient died a few weeks later.

Patient Information:
Name: Not provided
Gender: Female
Age: 50
Medical Record Number: Not provided

Diagnosis:
- Grade 2, lymph node-positive, ER-positive, HER2-negative invasive lobular carcinoma
- Sclerotic lesions in the iliac wings, likely to be due to osteopoikilosis

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to oncology for adjuvant treatment following a left-sided mastectomy and axillary clearance in 2012. She was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma. An isotope bone scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease, but an X-ray of the pelvis indicated sclerotic lesions mostly localized in the iliac wings. A CT scan of the thorax and abdomen revealed multiple small sclerotic nodules throughout the entire skeleton. The radiologist suggested that these lesions are likely metastatic deposits but could also be due to osteopoikilosis.

The Breast MDT opinion stated that a diagnosis of bone metastasis was unlikely given the normal bone scan, CA-15.3, bone profile, and absence of bone-related symptoms. The bony abnormalities detected on X-ray and CT were most likely caused by osteopoikilosis, and the patient underwent adjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy to the left chest and left supraclavicular fossa, alongside hormonal therapy.

Current Status:
Three years following the adjuvant treatment, there has been no evidence of disease recurrence. Follow-up CT scans performed in 2013 and 2014 showed stable appearances in the bones.

Recommendations:
The patient should continue to follow up with her oncologist for further assessments.",,,0

Length of Stay: 40 days

Diagnoses:
- Stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with no known genetic driver mutations
- High expression of PD-L1

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for the administration of third-line nivolumab after an initial partial response to biweekly carboplatin plus gemcitabine and administration of erlotinib. After four cycles of nivolumab, the patient showed a partial response to lung tumor mass, lymphatic nodes, and hepatic metastasis. Throughout the initial seven cycles, the patient showed no toxicity or adverse events. However, before the eighth cycle, the patient presented with elevated creatinine levels, which led to the suspected diagnosis of nephritis, and the cessation of nivolumab administration. A 24-hour urine test ruled out nephrotoxic syndrome, and methylprednisolone treatment was started. Creatinine levels decreased after two weeks, and nivolumab was restarted with reduced corticosteroid dosage. 
 
Before the fourteenth nivolumab cycle, the patient exhibited high levels of liver function metrics and was admitted to the hospital for daily monitoring of liver function. The subsequent CT scan showed a right axillary lymph node, with partial response in lung and liver metastases (dissociated response), and ruled out dilatation of the biliary conduct. The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis, prompting cessation of nivolumab administration, and an increase in methylprednisolone dosage. The patient remained asymptomatic during hospitalization. 

During an ambulatory visit at week 36, the patient experienced progressive dyspnea. A thoracic CT scan suggested non-specific pneumonitis, and the patient was admitted and treated with oxygen and an increased methylprednisolone dose. A bronchoscopy was performed, and the cultures of bronchial washings were positive for Pseudomonas and Candida. The patient recovered after two weeks of treatment and was discharged. 

At week 40, elevated bilirubin and transaminases were reported, and the patient was readmitted. The patient's clinical condition deteriorated, with the development of miliary liver metastases and progression of multiple thoracic lymph nodes. The patient and family opted for best supportive treatment as the patient was in a poor clinical state and in confirmed progression.
 
Discharge Condition:
The patient was discharged in a weakened clinical condition, with confirmed progression and metastases. The patient and family chose best supportive treatment.

Patient: 27-year-old female

Admission Date: [Date]

Discharge Date: [Date]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for respiratory failure and diagnosed with hypoplastic left lung syndrome. The patient underwent a multidisciplinary approach involving cardiology, pediatric surgery, pulmonology, and neonatology for her management. The patient underwent a trial of different ventilator modalities with a higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a course of dexamethasone, but it did not result in any improvement. Due to the futility of these efforts and the severe ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch in her left lung, a decision was made to trial left main bronchial plugging. 

The patient received an inflatable 5Fr bronchial blocker and underwent left bronchial blocker placement. This resulted in an immediate improvement of the patient's respiratory status with a decrease in oxygen requirement and improved ventilation with weaning of ventilator settings and better inflation of the right lung. The patient underwent surgical exploration by anterolateral thoracotomy, 80% of the emphysematous left upper lobe was removed, a small area of the pulmonary sequestration was also identified, and a chest tube was placed. The procedure was successful, and the patient's respiratory support was weaned as tolerated.

At the time of discharge, the patient's chest X-ray showed improvement, and she was discharged home two months after surgery. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with her primary care physician and specialists involved in her care. 

Discharge Diagnosis:

Hypoplastic left lung syndrome

History:
The 46-year-old male patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of left lower quadrant pain and a palpable mass in the left upper abdomen. The patient had no relevant past medical history or family history.

Physical Examination:
Physical examination revealed a large, tender mass in the left abdomen.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
Abdominal plain radiographs showed a large mass-like opacity in the left abdomen. Ultrasonography revealed a large, thick-walled cystic mass without evidence of an intracystic solid portion or septum. Contrast-enhanced CT images revealed an 18.3 × 12.3 × 21.5 cm sized oval cystic mass with a relatively thick wall in the left upper abdomen. Based on the imaging findings, a neurogenic tumor with cystic changes, a mucinous cystadenoma, and a pseudocyst were considered in the differential diagnoses. The patient underwent laparoscopic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy.

Hospital Course:
The intra-operative findings revealed that the mass had arisen from the retroperitoneum, closely related to the pancreas tail. The surgical specimen was a large round lump of soft tissue measuring 13 × 10.5 × 4.3 cm in size. The final pathologic diagnosis was DF.

Current Admission:
Presented with a five-day history of right hypochondriac abdominal pain associated with decreased appetite, nausea, vomiting, and icterus. A physical examination was unremarkable except for icterus and hepatomegaly. Fundoscopy did not reveal retinitis. Hepatomegaly with grade I-II intrahepatic biliary dilatation with a focal parenchymal lesion was seen on abdominal ultrasound. An ERCP was performed revealing a stenosis with CBD stricture, consistent with AIDS cholangiopathy. Papillotomy was performed, and a CBD stent was placed for biliary drainage. A bile aspirate was negative for Cryptosporidium, Microsporidium, Cyclospora, and Mycobacterium. Brush cytology of the stricture revealed inflammatory cells and pigment-laden macrophages with no acid-fast organisms. Histopathological examination of ampullary biopsy showed focal ulcerations with superficial mucosal necrosis and acute and chronic inflammation in the mucosa and lamina propria. Submucosal Brunner's glands showed nucleomegaly with eosinophilic intranuclear and basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions.

The patient was admitted with complaints of shortness of breath, abdominal distension, and persistent right calf pain of three-months duration. The patient had a history of recurrent thromboembolic events despite warfarin anticoagulation therapy. Review of symptoms revealed chest pain of four-year duration, a single episode of syncope, and recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) with pulmonary embolisms (PE). The patient’s family history was significant for mother with type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, and hypothyroidism; and a sister with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).

Assessment and Plan:
The patient was diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a cardiac mass attached to the anterior leaflet of the tricuspid valve (TV) and prolapsing into the right ventricle. Further evaluation by two-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography (2D-TEE) did not provide additional information. Chest computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a lobulated hypo-attenuating intracavitary right heart mass which appeared to be centered on the tricuspid valve. The most likely diagnosis of the mass was TV myxoma. However, pathologic report of the surgical specimen was consistent with chronic endocarditis with thrombi, rejecting the hypothesis of a cardiac myxoma and suggesting a diagnosis of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis (NBTE). Surgical intervention was necessary, and mass resection with TV replacement with a bio-prosthetic valve was performed. The patient's heart failure due to severe TV regurgitation was resolved, and he was discharged in stable condition. The patient was advised to follow up with his primary care physician for routine checkups and medication management.",,,0

CT scan showed fluid in the lesser sac suggestive of pancreatic hemorrhage, then he was transferred to the University of Kentucky Medical Center. Interventional radiology was consulted and an arterio-portal fistula in the liver was embolized with Embozene. The patient developed an elevated white blood cell count and increased abdominal distension following the procedure. A repeat CT scan revealed an increase in the size of the lesser sac hematoma and a pseudoaneurysm in the anterior spleen. Coil embolization of the splenic artery was performed with postembolization angiography showing no anterograde flow through the splenic artery. CT scan one month later revealed normal splenic parenchyma, with a persistent hematoma anterior and superior to the spleen.

The 75-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital due to left chest pain and dyspnea. A chest X-ray revealed a left pneumothorax, and a previous chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a subpleural pulmonary nodule with cavitation in the left upper lobe. The patient had a history of rheumatoid arthritis, acute coronary syndrome, and a right pneumothorax.

Treatment:

The patient underwent a series of pleurodesis procedures, including a blood patch, talc slurry, and OK-432. However, the pneumothorax relapsed after discharge, and thoracoscopic surgery was performed to resect the subpleural lesion that caused the intractable pneumothorax. The surgery was successful, and the patient experienced no recurrence of pneumothorax during 1 year of follow-up.

Diagnosis:

The final pathological diagnosis was a pulmonary rheumatoid nodule on the pleura.

Discussion:

It is not uncommon in less than 1% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis to develop pulmonary rheumatoid nodules, which can rupture into the pleural cavity and cause pneumothorax, empyema, and bronchopleural fistula. Due to poor wound healing and chronic local inflammation in the causative lesions, pneumothorax in patients with rheumatoid arthritis can be resistant to standard care. Pleurodesis via thoracoscopic surgery can be useful for treating patients with multiple rheumatoid nodules because this procedure can prevent recurrent pneumothorax resulting from the subsequent rupture of other nodules.

However, surgery to treat residual air leakage can be very difficult because of adhesions that have formed at other locations not contributing to the air leakage and because of the thick visceral pleura. A wide pleural covering technique with an oxidized regenerated cellulose mesh or a polyglycolic acid sheet can be used to treat an intractable pneumothorax rather than fistula resection and suturing in patients in whom the cause of pneumothorax is still unknown at the time of surgery.

In RA patients, it is important to obtain a pathological diagnosis of the underlying cause of pneumothorax because these patients have higher risks of lung malignancies than the general population.",,,0

He presented with an enlarging right-neck mass in November of 2015, which was found to be a malignant squamous cell carcinoma on fine-needle aspiration. No further treatment was pursued at that time due to socioeconomic issues. However, the patient experienced three flares of painful neck adenopathy over the next sixteen months, each of which was treated with short courses of antibiotics and steroids.

The patient returned in March of 2017 when his latest flare of right-sided neck adenopathy failed to respond to the usual treatment. A CT scan revealed multiple low-density cystic structures in the right neck consistent with necrotic lymph nodes. A PET-CT scan showed right neck hypermetabolic uptake, and a CT scan of the chest showed no obvious disease and no evidence of lymphadenopathy. Further testing revealed an ALK+ LBCL diagnosis based on H&E- stained mass excisional biopsy material. Additionally, NGS testing confirmed the absence of any significant genetic mutations associated with myeloid malignancies. The patient was subsequently admitted for further workup and management.

History of Present Illness: 
The patient presented to our hospital with a severe case of thyrotoxicosis and poor blood glucose control. He had a history of hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's disease and type 2 diabetes, for which he had been receiving insulin self-injection therapy. He had also undergone treatment for malignant melanoma of the nasal cavity, receiving one cycle of nivolumab therapy followed by two courses of ipilimumab therapy. His symptoms included fatigue, nausea, and sweating, which progressed to clinical and biochemical thyrotoxicosis after receiving a dual course of ipilimumab as a third treatment. On admission to our hospital, he presented with fever, tachycardia, agitation, and anxiety. He had a diffuse goiter without exophthalmoses and his blood pressure had decreased to 70/50 mmHg.

Hospital Course: 
The patient was treated with intravenously administered insulin infusion and intravenously administered fluid therapy. He was diagnosed as having destructive thyroiditis based on decreased uptake on thyroid scintigraphy. Treatment for thyroid storm was initiated with orally administered potassium iodide and a short-acting beta-adrenoreceptor blocker, landiolol hydrochloride, to control his heart rate. Prednisolone was also given as a treatment for irAE and thyroid storm. On day 5, his tachycardia had resolved, and the landiolol hydrochloride was discontinued. On day 11, his thyroid function had improved and the amount of total insulin used to control his blood glucose was decreased. On day 25, he was found to have hypothyroidism, and thyroid hormone replacement therapy was restarted.

On admission, the patient also reported gradually increasing weakness in both legs for 3 days that led to an inability to walk. The patient had a medical history significant for hepatitis C, for many years, which led to liver cirrhosis. The patient also had a history of a previously repaired umbilical hernia. The patient's family history included breast cancer (sister) and lung cancer (mother). The patient was a former heroin abuser, but never consumed alcohol. The patient worked as a manager in the laundry department in a hospital, and family members denied any exposure to asbestos. An ultrasound of the liver 1 year prior to the current presentation reported coarse echotexture suggestive of underlying cirrhosis. 

Physical examination revealed marked weakness of the patient's lower extremities and swelling over the T9 area of his spine. On neurological examination, the patient was alert and awake, oriented to time, his name, and his location; and his cranial nerves were grossly intact. While no gait disturbance was observed, severe cord compression was noted due to a pathologic fracture at T11. Magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic and lumbar spine revealed numerous metastatic lesions, and a large right liver mass and multiple lesions were also seen in MRI scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

Surgical spinal cord decompression and stabilization/fusion of his spine was performed, and pathology results of an intervertebral disc and the T9 vertebral body showed metastatic carcinoma favoring HCC. Tumor cells were positive for Hep Par-1 and glypican-3 and negative for CK7, CK20, TTF-1, inhibin, OCT3/4, PSA, PSAP, RCC, and PAX8.

Reason for Admission:

The patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with chest pain.

Hospital Course:

The patient had an electrocardiogram (ECG) showing normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy, with no significant ST or T wave changes. Cardiac biomarkers showed normal creatine kinase-muscle/brain (CK-MB) with mild troponin elevation, which subsequently normalized. Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a normal left ventricular size and function, with a normal ejection fraction (55%-65%) and wall motion. Nuclear exercise stress testing did not demonstrate ischemia. A CCTA was performed even though the stress test was negative, which did not reveal significant coronary artery disease (CAD), showing only a mild stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) artery.

After two weeks, the patient returned to the ED, complaining of a similar chest pain, occurring at rest, with radiation to the neck, and partial response to nitroglycerin. The ECG demonstrated ST elevation in leads V1-V2 and aVR, with ST depression in the lateral leads. The patient was emergently taken to the cardiac catheterization lab and was found to have a significant proximal LAD lesion, requiring a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with the placement of a drug-eluting stent. Post PCI, the chest pain and ECG changes resolved. Troponin levels peaked at 3.1 ng/ml.

Chief Complaint:
Patient was admitted with right intermittent claudication of 3 years.

History of Present Illness:
Patient, a 76-year-old Asian man, had a 55-year history of dm2 and had been treated with insulin for 3 years. Upon vascular examination, the patient had a right femoral bruit and diminished right popliteal pulse, suggesting the presence of a right femoral lesion. However, the right ankle-brachial index (ABI) measured by a volume plethysmograph was 1.28, within the normal range, while the left ABI was elevated to 1.55, indicating that the infrapopliteal arteries at the left ankle were incompressible. Upstroke time of the right ankle was prolonged, whereas upstroke time of the left ankle was within the normal range. These findings suggest that the right ABI was falsely normalized due to incompressible infrapopliteal arteries at the right ankle despite the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD) in the right extremity.

Past Medical History:
The patient had diabetic retinopathy and a 55-year history of dm2.

Hospital Course:
The patient was treated with supervised exercise training and did not undergo revascularization. After completion of the 6-month supervised exercise training program, he continued to spend 2 hours a day walking. Five years from the initial assessment, the right ABI had decreased to 0.83, with upstroke time at the right ankle indicating the progression of the right lower extremity PAD. However, there was no deterioration in his symptoms, and he had no difficulty in performing daily activities.

Diagnostic Tests:
Intra-arterial angiography revealed the presence of a severe stenotic lesion at the origin of the right superficial femoral artery, whereas there was no occlusive arterial disease in the left extremity. Fluoroscopic images showed severe calcification of infrapopliteal arteries at the right ankle. Computed tomography also revealed severe calcification of the bilateral infrapopliteal arteries.

Admitting Diagnosis: Suspected urinary tract infection with perineal pain and fever

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient, a 56-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled insulin-dependent type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypothyroidism, and meatal stenosis with incomplete bladder emptying, was admitted into the hospital with symptoms of perineal pain and fever. The patient had been seen in the emergency room a week prior to the admission with the same complaints and was placed on a 14-day course of antibiotics. 

Upon admission, the patient was hemodynamically stable, but physical examination showed mild tenderness at penoscrotal junction with induration, elevated white blood cell count, creatinine level, and hemoglobin A1c levels. Emphysematous changes were noted on CT scan, and the patient had a postvoid residual of 320 ml. Thus, a transurethral Foley catheter was placed with withdrawal of 700 ml of clear yellow urine; culture reports are still pending.

The patient was initiated on intravenous meropenem, fluconazole, and daptomycin. A subsequent CT scan showed no significant changes, and the patient remained febrile. Based on the recommendation of the Infectious Disease team, the patient was switched to piperacillin/tazobactam which resulted in a slight decrease in fever. A pelvic MRI with and without gadolinium was obtained, and reduced blood flow to corpus spongiosum compared to corpus cavernosum with gadolinium was discovered.

Due to worsening symptoms, the patient underwent debridement of remaining necrotic spongiosal tissue and placement of a penrose drain. The intraoperative wound culture later tested positive for Candida glabrata, which was identical to the patient's urine culture. According to the recommendation of the Infectious Disease team, the patient was prescribed micafungin for the infection, and he was discharged on a 14-day course of oral voriconazole with the transurethral Foley in place.

Final diagnosis: Candida glabrata infection with necrotizing spongiositis of the penis.

Follow-up:
The patient was instructed to follow-up with his urologist for evaluation of the persistent induration in the penoscrotal junction and the transurethral Foley. He was also advised to monitor his blood sugar levels closely, ensure proper nutrition and exercise, follow up with his primary care physician, and continue taking his prescribed medications. 

Overall, the patient's condition had improved, and he was advised to seek medical attention immediately if he experiences any concerning symptoms or see his urologist if any new symptoms arise.",,,1

Patient Name: [INSERT PATIENT NAME]
DOB: [INSERT DATE OF BIRTH]
Gender: Female

Medical History:
The patient was referred to this tertiary hospital for specialist evaluation of a non-specific cough, which was present for 6 weeks associated with a right pulmonary mass. The physical examination revealed diminished breath sounds on the right side of the lung. Chest radiograph revealed a mass located in the right upper lobe and middle lobe of the right lung, with a central area of calcification. Chest computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed the chest radiograph findings, and surgical removal of the mass was performed.

Hospital Course:
Thoracotomy was performed on the right side, and the lesion was resected, leading to lobectomy of both upper lobe and middle lobe. No associated lymphadenopathy was noted. Macroscopically, a well-circumscribed mass measuring 5.5 × 5.5 × 4 cm was present, and the excised tumor had an osseous center measuring 2 × 1 × 1 cm. From the histological point of view, the mass consisted of disorganization of the normal bronchoalveolar parenchyma, myofibroblastic cells, and inflammatory cell infiltrates, such as lymphocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, and histiocytes. In the center of the lesion, a large ossification was found.

Results:
Immunohistochemistry revealed calponin antigens, SMA, desmin, P53, bcL2, CK, HMW, and, in several myofibroblastic cells, expression of ALK-1. It was negative for beta-catenin, cyclin D1, Myo-D1, S100p, CD34, CD99, and CD117. The histological and immunohistochemistry characteristics were compatible with an inflammatory myofibroblastic pseudotumor.

Outcome:
The post-operative course was uneventful, and the patient was discharged home after 2 weeks of surgery. The patient re-presented to the hospital 1 year after surgery. The child had normal daily activities, normal chest x-ray and no recurrences.

Admitting Diagnosis: Complete bifid penis

Medical History: The patient was brought to the Center for Anatomical Science and Education for anatomical dissection purposes, under the Saint Louis University Gift Body Program.

Hospital Course: During routine dissection, it was observed that the patient had a bifid penis that was 9.2 cm long and divided longitudinally into right and left parts, each with its own glans and prepuce. There was no urethra in the phallus, and the urethral meatus was located at the base of the divided phallus, indicating proximal penoscrotal hypospadias.

A histological examination showed that the epithelial lining of the urinary bladder extended to 3.9 cm on the ventral surface of each phallus and resembled stratified squamous epithelium. The scrotum was large, containing left and right testes with a normally routed spermatic cord. There was no epididymis, but the vas deferens continued directly from each testis to the seminal vesicle of the same side.

Pathologic-examination showed a small mass of hard tissue on the left side, measuring 0.5 cm by 0.5 cm, located at the site of the prostate gland. Histologically, it did not resemble prostatic glandular tissue and did not have any connection with the vas deferens or seminal vesicle.

Discharge Diagnosis: Complete bifid penis with proximal penoscrotal hypospadias accompanied by absent epididymis.

Discharge Instructions: Due to the nature of the patient's situation, no necessary discharge instructions were provided.

Patient Name: [redacted]
Gender: Female
Age: 32 years old

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with photosensitivity, malar rash, and oral ulcers since childhood. She presented with amenorrhea six months after normal childbirth. A history of a positive home pregnancy test two months prior to her admission, followed by a diagnosis of a miscarriage. She had progressive edema a month before admission.

Hospital Course:
On admission, the patient had moderate edema on the face and both legs. She underwent several tests, which indicated nephrotic syndrome, proteinuria, and mild hematuria. The CT scan also showed bilateral pleural effusion, ascites, and swelling of the uterus with low-density areas. A renal biopsy was performed, which showed a thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)-like glomerular lesion.

Diagnosis:
Based on the patient's previous history of lymphopenia, renal disorder, and positive anti-cardiolipin IgG antibodies, she was initially diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus according to the 2012 SLICC criteria. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) was also suspected due to the TMA-like glomerular lesion.

Treatment:
The patient was initially treated with prednisolone, beraprost sodium, and warfarin, which helped in reducing the edema. However, proteinuria persisted at around 2-3 g/day. The patient's serum human β-subunit of chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level was measured, and she was subsequently diagnosed with an exaggerated placental site, for which methotrexate therapy was initiated. The patient's serum β-hCG level decreased to 87.9 mIU/mL, but follow-up imaging studies revealed abnormal uterine findings suggesting a trophoblastic tumor. Total hysterectomy was performed, and after two months, her proteinuria disappeared, and her serum β-hCG level normalized. A follow-up renal biopsy eight months after the hysterectomy revealed the disappearance of the TMA-like glomerular lesion.

Patient: 2-year-old female Scottish Terrier dog

Clinical Presentation:
The patient presented with erosive and ulcerative lesions affecting the nasal planum since the age of four months. The condition was neither painful nor pruritic.

Medical History:
The patient had been previously treated with short courses of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and prednisone, leading to temporary improvement. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated from the nasal tissues, and marbofloxacin was administered for one month without improvement. Methylprednisolone acetate was then administered, causing brief improvement followed by worsening of the lesions. The patient had no history of previous diseases. The patient was regularly vaccinated, dewormed, and on heartworm prevention, fed a commercial dry food, and received a fipronil-S-methoprene spot-on product monthly for flea and tick prevention.

Clinical Findings:
On dermatological examination, wide and deep ulcers were seen, with complete destruction of the nasal planum, philtrum, and nostrils as well as the central part of the upper lips. The ulcerative process also affected the gum, in correspondence with the upper central incisors.

Differential Diagnosis:
Differential diagnoses considered included nasal planum vasculopathy of the Scottish Terrier dog, dermal arteritis of the nasal philtrum, discoid lupus erythematosus, pemphigus complex, squamous cell carcinoma, and leishmaniosis.

Treatment:
The patient was treated with oral prednisolone and oral ciclosporin for three weeks. The prednisolone was slowly tapered and discontinued after 20 weeks of therapy, while ciclosporin was continued at the same dosage. Two stents were placed in the nostrils in order to prevent abnormal scarring and subsequent stenosis, which were well tolerated by the patient and definitely removed after six months from the first application.

Follow-Up:
The patient's ulcers markedly decreased in size and depth and completely regressed within five months after stents removal. There was complete re-epithelialization of the muzzle, although with severe scarring, and regrowth of hair at the periphery of the affected area. The nasal planum and the central part of the upper lip were absent, and two remnants of the nares were present; however, the dog could breathe and eat normally. The patient continues to take 5 mg/kg ciclosporin orally once daily, breathes and eats normally, and the quality of life is excellent.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the hospital with a complaint of decreased vision in the left eye. She had a 15-year history of seropositive RA and was on methotrexate and deflazacort until 8 months prior to admission when she was initiated on etanercept.

On presentation, the patient showed BCVA of 0.8 OD and 0.1 OS. Funduscopic examination revealed granular infiltration at the temporal macula in the right eye and the foveal area in the left eye. SD-OCT showed swollen ellipsoid zone and RPE irregularities in both eyes. Autifluorescence revealed parafoveal granular hyperautofluorescence in both eyes.

Based on the negative results of various blood tests, the patient was diagnosed with noninfectious uveitis and started on oral prednisolone. However, there was mild improvement a month after treatment, and the patient later experienced a visual loss to 0.1 in the right eye with swollen ellipsoid zone in the fovea and newly developed subRPE yellow-white deposits in the inferotemporal area. 

The patient underwent a 25-gauge microincision vitrectomy of the right eye, which revealed atypical mononuclear cells with positive CD20 immunostaining. PCR of the vitreous fluid was negative for herpes and cytomegalovirus. Given the potential causal relationship between PIOL and anti-TNFα agents, etanercept was discontinued.

The patient was then treated with high-dose systemic methotrexate as well as intravitreal methotrexate injections for induction, and once weekly for eight weeks followed by once monthly for nine months in the right eye. 

Three months after the treatment, the patient showed a decrease in subretinal infiltration and subRPE deposits, which further resolved at 6 months following treatment. Over the course, her left eye showed gradual improvement in funduscopic examination and SD-OCT findings without intravitreal methotrexate injection, potentially due to systemic chemotherapy. The final BCVA of the patient was 0.1 OD and 0.4 OS.

Clinical Course:
The patient was admitted with a left lobe complex nodule within a nontoxic multinodular goiter that had been enlarging for approximately 3 years. The patient had previously undergone a FNAB reported as benign, BC II. A second FNA biopsy approximately six months later was reported as a Hürthle cell neoplasm or suspicious for a Hürthle cell neoplasm, BC IV.

The patient underwent ultrasound imaging, which revealed that the nodule had grown from 4.9 to 6.0 cm over the course of 1 year. He was euthyroid with negative anti-thyroid antibodies. CT scan showed a markedly enlarged left thyroid lobe causing significant rightward tracheal deviation, minimal tracheal compression, and slight early substernal extension.

Multiple opinions from both endocrinologists and surgeons were sought. The patient had initially contemplated a hemithyroidectomy due to concerns for voice impairment that could impact his occupation as an attorney. However, after a second surgical consultation and further molecular testing with ThyroSeq® v3, the patient elected to have a total thyroidectomy. At surgery, an encapsulated 7 cm Hürthle cell carcinoma with 5 foci of angioinvasion was found along with foci of capsular invasion, without extrathyroidal extension.

Chief Complaint:
Sudden onset generalised weakness affecting predominantly lower limbs after eating dinner, multiple similar episodes over the past month, associated with 15-kilogram weight loss over the past three months and a four-day history of nonbloody diarrhoea, which resolved one week prior to presentation.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism associated with TPP secondary to Graves' disease and was treated with intravenous KCl and MgSO4. Further treatment included Carbimazole 20 mg twice a day and Propranolol 20 mg three times a day, with no potassium supplementation prescribed on discharge.

Outcome:
The patient's weakness had resolved during inpatient admission, and he reported no further episodes of weakness upon discharge. His T4 and T3 had normalized, and his potassium was within the normal range. Ongoing monitoring of thyroid function was recommended, with a plan for radioiodine ablation or thyroid surgery if antithyroid medical therapy was unsuccessful. No anticoagulation therapy was advised due to his low risk of thromboembolism.

Follow-up:
Further follow-up information was not attainable as the patient returned to his home overseas. However, the patient was advised to seek medical care immediately if he experienced any further episodes of weakness.

Recommendations:
Based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, his condition seems to have been caused by hyperthyroidism associated with TPP secondary to Graves' disease. The patient was advised to continue medical management of his thyroid function and remain observant of any recurrence of symptoms.",,,0

The patient was a 1-month-old female with unilateral left facial palsy who presented with low-grade fever, purulent otorrhea, and respiratory distress. Physical examination revealed facial asymmetry and unilateral peripheral facial nerve palsy, but no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. The initial laboratory evaluation showed leukocytosis with prominent PMNs on the peripheral blood smear, as well as mild granulocytic dysplasia. The CSF analysis showed elevated white blood cell count with neutrophil predominance, while bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed the presence of the Ph chromosome, consistent with CML. 

Treatment with vancomycin and ceftriaxone was initiated but there was no response. The patient experienced a seizure on the second day of hospitalization, and on day 6, a bone survey revealed no abnormalities throughout the bones. The patient received imatinib mesylate, but after 12 days of hospitalization, suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest with unsuccessful resuscitation efforts.

2285,"Hospital Course Summary:

Patient is a 38-year-old female who was admitted to our hospital with blackish discoloration and ulceration on her right big toe and left fourth toe. She had a previous diagnosis of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) with Raynaud's phenomenon and was on treatment for two years before presenting to us. She had no previous systemic complaints, and her DAS-28 was within the remission range.

On examination, there was mild pallor, but no joint deformity, jaundice, or rash. Peripheral pulses were palpable in all limbs, but there was reduced blood flow in left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries with reduced peak systolic velocities on Doppler ultrasound. The patient's platelet count was persistently elevated, prompting further work-up that revealed a positive JAK2 V617 mutation and histological findings suggestive of Essential Thrombocytosis on bone marrow trephine biopsy.

Following confirmation of the revised diagnosis, treatment was modified to include Aspirin 75 mg and Hydroxyurea 1 gram per day in addition to her RA treatment. The patient responded well to the treatment with regards to clinical and laboratory parameters. However, she developed gangrene of the toe, leading to the amputation of the distal phalanx of the toe and nail excision. Anagrelide was started after a surge in her platelet counts, and the patient is on regular follow-up visits.

Overall, this was a challenging case of Rheumatoid Arthritis with associated Essential Thrombocytosis that required close monitoring and timely intervention.

Patient: 46-year-old Japanese woman with a known history of SLE

Admission Date: [insert]

Admission Diagnosis: DAH-induced hypoxemia accompanying SLE

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was initially admitted with sudden weight loss and respiratory distress. After admission, the patient was immediately given 50 mg of oral prednisolone. Approximately three weeks after the start of treatment, the dosage was reduced to 45 mg/day, but the patient suddenly developed hemoptysis and respiratory distress. The chest X-ray showed infiltrative shadows in both lung fields, with greater density in the right lung. The CT scan showed pulmonary infiltrates along the peripheral bronchovascular bundles and ground-glass opacities. The patient was diagnosed with DAH-induced hypoxemia accompanying SLE and high-dose corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone 500 mg/day) was initiated. However, respiratory distress worsened, and immunosuppressive therapy (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/day) was also started three days after the start of high-dose corticosteroid therapy. The patient was transferred to the ICU and placed on mechanical ventilation.

Although the patient produced copious quantities of bloody secretions after intubation, the secretions were reduced when APRV was set to the highest airway pressure (35 cmH2O). We administered oxygen through an oxygen mask (flow rate: 6 L/min) while in the ICU.

Under these conditions, the patient's respiratory function substantially improved, with a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.60 and a PaO2 of 117.6 mmHg. During approximately three consecutive weeks of APRV and steroid therapy, the patient demonstrated gradual improvements in respiratory function, and a CT scan after extubation showed that the pulmonary infiltrates and ground-glass opacities had disappeared. Mechanical ventilation was discontinued 25 days after admission to the ICU. The patient was moved to the general ward and continued on oral steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 16 mg/day).

The patient's respiratory and hemodynamic parameters showed gradual improvement over the course of hospitalization. The patient was successfully discharged 102 days after admission to the ICU.

Instructions on Discharge:

The patient is advised to continue taking oral steroid therapy (methylprednisolone 16 mg/day for the next [insert time period]) and to schedule follow-up appointments with the attending physician.

Admission Diagnosis: Chronic right-sided headache, foul discharge and complaints of a stuffed nose

Hospital Course

The patient was admitted with chronic right-sided headache, foul discharge and complaints of a stuffed nose. He had a previous medical history of maxillary osteomyelitis and had undergone multiple interventions resulting in a complex mediofacial resection.

Diagnostic testing showed a huge pathologic cavity resulting from communication between the oral cavity, right maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity, with a minor communication with the right orbit. Biopsy specimens were obtained under general anesthesia and showed severe but unspecific changes of the nasal epithelium with areas of minimal remaining preserved respiratory epithelium. Evident unspecific changes were also present in the submucosa with squamous cell metaplasia of the submucosal glands in some cases leading to complete replacement of the glandular epithelia and resulting in submucosal squamous cell nests, without signs of cellular atypia.

Based on the clinical data and diagnostic testing, the patient was diagnosed with ENS not elsewhere classified (NEC) as the currently used classification does not include such an entity.

The patient was discharged following training for self-lavage of the neocavity, due to refusal for obturator placement to compartmentalize the neocavity and restore physiological relation of its sections. A seven-year follow-up period included multiple hospital admissions for monitoring of the condition and extensive sinus lavage. No advancement was noticed on endoscopy and CT.

Recommendations

Further histological evaluations were not performed due to the steady clinical course and lack of evidence for malignant transformation of the now squamous epithelial lining of the neocavity. The patient should continue self-lavage of the neocavity and should be monitored for any changes.",,,0

This patient was admitted to the Paediatric Unit of the Santa Maria Hospital, Terni, Italy, at the age of 3 years for further evaluation of his already diagnosed epileptic encephalopathy with tonic and myoclonic seizures and spasms. The patient had a significant hypertonus of the lower limbs, neuromotor and psychic development was very poor, and presented severe cognitive disability and severe postural spastic paresis with a dystonic-myoclonic component.

Diagnostic Evaluation:
The patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which revealed complex brain malformations such as pontocerebellar hypoplasia, corpus callosum atrophy, and simplified cortical architecture. The results were also consistent with a posterior laryngomalacia. The patient underwent a cardiological consultation and renal ultrasound, which did not reveal any abnormalities, and no congenital cardiac cardiopathies were observed.

Hospital Course:
The patient continued to show repeated daily critical episodes, characterized by a polymorphic tonic semeiology with an inconstant clonic component, tonic spasms in extension, tonic deviation of the head on the left and inflection adduction of the right upper limb, and clonus of the head and upper left limb. The electroencephalogram (EEG) showed a poorly organized pattern for the age of the subject. On the centro-temporal derivations of the two hemispheres, theta-delta band rhythms were present, followed by intermittent repetitions of sharp waves, mainly evident on the left hemisphere where they assume a subcontinuous morphology. The cortical electrical anomalies were evident in the centro-temporal areas of both cerebral hemispheres, especially on the left side.

Plan:
The patient underwent tracheotomy and percutaneous gastrostomy procedures due to poor swallowing aptitude. The patient was discharged and referred to neurology and paediatrics outpatient clinics with ongoing follow-up.

Reason for Admission:

The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with worsening right shoulder pain, radiating down the right arm, and accompanied by intermittent fevers for the last two days.

Hospital Course:

The patient had mild leukocytosis with predominant neutrophilia and an elevated C-reactive protein level. The initial shoulder aspirate analysis was negative for any organisms, but showed some scanty pus cells. The patient was started on intravenous flucloxacillin due to her continuing temperature spikes, and an MRI was ordered, which confirmed subscapularis abscess formation as the cause of the patient's presenting symptoms. The patient underwent surgical open drainage of the right subscapularis abscess under general anaesthesia that yielded PVL- positive S. aureus sensitive to flucloxacillin.

The patient was given a two-week course of flucloxacillin and was followed up after six weeks, during which the wound had healed well, and the shoulder pain had resolved with no signs of infection recurrence. The patient still exhibited limited range of movement of the shoulder for which she was referred to physiotherapy.

The 54-year-old male with a history of alcohol abuse was admitted to the emergency with acute-onset, diffuse, cramping abdominal pain, worst in the epigastrium and lasting one day. He had no prior abdominal surgeries. Upon examination, he had moderate guarding and generalized tenderness with hypoactive bowel sounds. The laboratory evaluation showed microcytic anemia and thrombocytopenia on complete blood count, hypokalemia on basic metabolic profile, and a normal lipase level. Abdominal X-ray showed an evolving small bowel obstruction, which was confirmed by a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast. On the same CT scan series, a urachal remnant with a superimposed mass lesion was depicted.

An emergent surgery was performed to release the small bowel obstruction after receiving a platelet transfusion. During the surgery, an extensive mass was found concerning for a malignancy. A frozen section was intraoperatively sent and read as adenocarcinoma. An incisional biopsy of the urachal mass was also sent, which resulted in a final pathology specimen of a moderately differentiated urachal adenocarcinoma.

The patient was staged at Stage IIID (Sheldon staging) due to the spread to local viscera other than the bladder. Due to the involvement of multiple loops of the small bowel and the mesentery of the small and large bowels, the tumor was deemed unresectable. Systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), folinic acid, and oxaliplatin (modified FOLFOX-6) was initiated. The patient completed six cycles of chemotherapy and tolerated it well.

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to our facility with a perforated left cornea and a history of non-penetrating left eye injury. He had a corneal scar and poor vision due to the injury caused by a bamboo plant. He also had poorly controlled hypertension, high cholesterol, and diabetes mellitus. On the first visit, his left eye was found to have a descemetocele with microleakage. Uneventful corneal gluing with a bandage contact lens was performed. The patient was discharged home with moxifloxacin and lubricant eye drops, atropine eye drops, ciprofloxacin tablets, and acetazolamide tablets. During the follow-up period, the patient's clinical condition was stable until he complained of visual loss. He was readmitted for amniotic membrane transplantation because of suspected microleakage. Unfortunately, the AMT was unsuccessful, and further corneal perforations were observed. A second graft was performed, which eventually led to corneal cross-linking to strengthen corneal integrity. At the end of the hospital course, no further corneal melting was observed. The patient's eye was saved from enucleation or evisceration.

Diagnosis:
Perforated left cornea due to non-penetrating left eye injury

Plan:
The patient received prophylactic antibiotics and antifungal medications, amniotic membrane transplantation, and corneal grafts. He was provided with medications and discharged home with a plan to attend diabetes clinic visits and follow up with ophthalmology. The patient had a good response to the treatment and was eventually discharged with no further complications.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital following a motor vehicle accident resulting in a loss of consciousness lasting less than one hour. The patient complained of severe abdominal and left hip pain upon arrival to the ED. The patient's vital signs upon admission were within normal limits, with the exception of low blood pressure, which subsequently improved. The patient was noted to have a positive seat belt sign and a focused assessment with sonography for trauma exam revealed a positive finding in the right upper quadrant. Leiomyomata uteri were incidentally found on ultrasound.

During surgery, a midline laparotomy was performed with an immediate upwelling of blood. The abdomen was packed in all four quadrants to control bleeding and stabilize blood pressure. Upon inspection of the lower quadrants, a free-floating mass of tissue later identified as a leiomyoma was found. In addition, the uterus was noted to be bleeding from a 5 cm fundal laceration. The gynecologic team proceeded with a myomectomy of the subserosal leiomyoma and closure of the uterine laceration. The abdominal incision was then closed, with a total estimated blood loss of 1000 mL. The patient was administered 2 units each of red blood cells and fresh frozen plasma, as well as 1.3L of crystalloid intraoperatively.

On post op day 1, the patient experienced a downtrending hemoglobin and was given a third unit of red blood cells. On post op day 2, the patient developed nausea and a nasogastric tube was inserted, resulting in 1 liter of green bilious output.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Admitting Diagnosis: Metastatic Melanoma
Discharge Diagnosis: Remission of Metastatic Melanoma

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 53-year-old female, was admitted to our hospital in February 2019 with left inguinal swelling. Core biopsy later confirmed it to be melanoma, which was diagnosed as metastatic melanoma (cTx, pN1b, M1). After her left inguinal node dissection in March 2019, she was started on pembrolizumab for the treatment of her condition. However, in January 2020, she presented to the outpatient oncology with progressive weakness, fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, poor appetite, weight loss, and mood changes over a period of 6-8 weeks. She was diagnosed with pembrolizumab-induced hypophysitis, and her treatment was modified accordingly.

Management and Treatment:
The patient was started on prednisone 1 mg/kg/day with gradual tapering to the maintenance dose of 10 mg daily after being diagnosed with pembrolizumab-induced hypophysitis. She responded well to the therapy, and her cortisol levels normalized in March 2020. Pembrolizumab treatment was resumed in March 2020, and she completed the course in April 2021. Her repeat chest CT scans in May 2020 were negative for any recurrent cancer. She is currently tolerating pembrolizumab, reporting good energy levels without any fatigue, myalgia, or mood changes while still on prednisone 7.5 mg daily.

Condition at Discharge:
The patient's latest follow-up in August 2021 did not show any evidence of recurrent disease, and she was discharged from our hospital in remission of metastatic melanoma.

Follow-up Care:
The patient was advised to continue prednisone 7.5 mg daily for the next few months and to have regular follow-up visits with an oncologist.

Final Diagnosis:
Metastatic melanoma in remission.

The 19-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital in December 2017 with a recent diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. The patient presented with pharyngeal pain and a left neck mass with fever for 2 months. The patient received a tracheotomy because of airway obstruction resulting from a large mass arising from the left parapharyngeal space at a local clinic. PET/CT scan shows a large solid mass located in the left parapharyngeal space with compression of the pharyngeal cavity and multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck. The histopathological review confirmed diagnosis of histiocytic sarcoma. 

Treatment and Management:

Chemotherapy was initially started with the aim of stabilization of the fulminate disease course; however, the lesions did not shrink and pain and dysphagia were heavier caused by the compression of the pharynx. In order to relieve the compression, irradiation to the lesions of pharyngeal and neck was started. After irradiation, the size of lesions became a little bit smaller.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of tumor tissue was performed and showed the presence of oncogenic mutations. The patient began to take a specific medication. After one month of treatment, a partial response was observed. The medication was continued for two months, however, the patient could no longer afford such an expensive drug. 

NGS was done again and the patient was treated with a medication that was more affordable. Two months after the treatment, excellent PR was observed compared with tumor size in March 2018. Four months later the re-evaluation showed a nearly complete remission. 

Follow-Up:

The patient took maintenance medication for two years and stopped the treatment in March 2020. To date, 45 months after HS diagnosis, she is still alive without tumor recurrence.",,,1

Patient: 33-year-old male with a history of Crohn’s disease

Hospital course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital due to the progression of stoma stenosis caused by abdominal wall abscess formation around his ascending colonic stoma. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was detected in the patient's fecal culture examination. Consistent with the diagnosis of Crohn’s disease, the patient underwent colectomy and colostomy surgeries and was treated conservatively for progressive inflammation before surgery. Afterward, the patient underwent colostomy closure, ileocecal resection, abdominal wall abscess and fistula debridement, and ileostomy construction through a midline incision. The patient was classified as ASA physical class 2 and wound was stratified as class IV. The long operation time and dirty, infected condition created a high risk for surgical site infection (SSI). However, the surgical site was successfully closed with no signs of infection on POD 14.

Treatment:
Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) was applied after surgery using the V.A.C. system (KCI USA, Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA). The dressing was changed every 2 days, and the skin defect wound was closed using sutures from both edges in a stepwise manner. For the postoperative period, the patient was administered prophylactic antibiotics, 1 g of cefmetazole intravenously once every 12 h for 7 days. The wound was continuously monitored, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on POD16.

Outcome:
The patient's condition improved daily, and the wound site was closed without any signs of infection on POD 14. The pathological examination of the surgical specimen revealed colonic stenosis and chronic inflammation, but no malignant changes were observed. The patient's laboratory findings were within the normal ranges, except for anemia and malnutrition, respectively. In conclusion, the patient demonstrated a successful response to NPWT application in the treatment of the wound site, and the healing process was well-managed by the clinical staff.",,,1

- Hypotension
- General illness

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient presented with skin ischemic lesions with rapid deterioration to whole body cyanosis and metabolic and lactic acidosis. Blood cultures confirmed the diagnosis of sepsis from Streptococcus pneumoniae paralleled with severe purpura fulminans. Empirical antibiotic therapy started with ceftriaxone (2 g every 12h) and levofloxacin (500 mg every 12h) for 11 and 7 days, respectively, with adjustments due to renal function changes. 
The patient later became oligoanuric, severely hypotonic with hemodynamic instability (epinephrine 0.4 μg/kg/min), and thrombocytopenic, presenting severe bleeding. A CVVHDF treatment in combination with one 24-hour session of Cytosorb hemoadsorption was started immediately after the ICU admission. 
This combined treatment resulted in a clear and progressive hemodynamic stabilization accompanied with a marked reduction of epinephrine to 0.1 μg/kg/min and a reduction of CRP from 17.5 mg/dl to 13 mg/dl. Lactacidemia, elevated at the admission (15 mmol/l), decreased until 4 in the first 24h. At the same time, PCT decreased from 18.35 ng/ml to 2 ng/ml after 6 days.

Hospital Course:

A 59-year-old woman with a history of locally advanced bladder cancer and primary lung adenocarcinoma presented with extensive bleeding from her ileostomy site. She had undergone pelvic exenteration and ileal conduit formation in November 2015. CT imaging performed in January 2016 raised the possibility of cirrhosis; however, this was not biopsy-proven. In April 2016, she began to notice intermittent bleeding from her stoma. In December 2016, her first episode of confusion was noted and CT imaging demonstrated strong radiographic suspicion for cirrhosis together with prominent vessels surrounding the urinary diversion site suspicious for portal hypertension. She was diagnosed clinically with cryptogenic cirrhosis in May 2017 during a hospitalization for fatigue, anasarca, and altered mental status. An upper endoscopy performed in June 2017 demonstrated portal hypertensive gastropathy but no esophageal varices. 

When the patient presented to the Emergency Department in July 2017 with significant hemorrhage from her stoma, she was emergently taken to the interventional suite for embolization via peristomal varix access. The catheter position was confirmed with repeat venography, and multiple coils were deployed followed by Gelfoam embolization. Postembolization venography showed sluggish flow in the draining varix with multiple filling defects within the visualized collaterals consistent with embolization. Given the successful outcome of the procedure, the patient became hemodynamically stable shortly thereafter. At 6-month follow-up time no further imaging had been performed, and the patient had not had any further episodes of hemorrhage from the ileostomy site.

Diagnosis:

1. Cryptogenic cirrhosis with portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Summary:

The patient presented with extensive bleeding from her ileostomy site and subsequently underwent successful embolization via peristomal varix access.

The patient, a 10 year-old girl, was admitted with the complaint of palpitations. Physical examination and laboratory tests were performed which indicated tachycardia (heart rate = 130 per minute) and low TSH levels (0.005) with normal T3 (9.46) and T4 (145). The patient was referred to an endocrinologist due to the possibility of hyperthyroidism. The thyroid gland was visualized and appeared normal size with no nodularity. The patient underwent thyroid scan to rule out possible thyroiditis, which indicated an increased uptake in the right ovary (). Following pelvic trans-abdominal sonography, a heterogeneous complex solid mass of 113 × 112 × 100 mm with a volume of 670 cc was observed in the right ovary with no ascites.

The possible diagnosis of struma ovarii was made, and the patient was treated with methimazole 10 mg daily and propranolol 40 mg daily. A gynecologist performed right oophorectomy with presumption of teratoma, and it was later determined that the ovary mass was indicative of teratocarcinoma with 60% well-differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma and 40% well differentiated follicular-variant with tumor necrosis, microscopic capsular invasion and peritumoral lymphovascular invasion, considering stage IC of PTC (). Total thyroidectomy was then performed for evaluation for metastatic disease and monitoring for recurrence by thyroglobulin levels. Metastasis was then discovered in lymph nodes and hyperthyroidism was administered with iodine therapy (150 mCi) twice. Following the final whole body scan, no trace of iodine uptake was found, and the patient is now under treatment with levothyroxine 0.1 mg daily.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with sudden onset of difficulty using her left hand and walking during her menstrual phase. She also complained of headache, abdominal pain, nausea, and had a fever. Neurologic examination revealed left spatial neglect, left facial hypoalgesia, mild paresis in her left arm, and right pyramidal signs. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilaterally multiple infarctions in the cerebrum and cerebellum, including cortical and subcortical lesions. MR angiography presented severe stenosis in the M2, M3, >and M4 portions of the right middle cerebral artery. Contrast computed tomography revealed a splenic infarction. Blood examination revealed normocytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and low-grade elevation of C-reactive protein. The serum levels of D-dimer, CA125, and carbohydrate antigen 19–9 (CA19–9) were increased. Results of a hypercoagulable panel were within normal limits. Pelvic MRI revealed giant adenomyosis, but no malignancy was detected.

The patient was initially treated with edaravone and anticoagulated with heparin for 2 weeks, followed by rivaroxaban. At day 31, a day after her menstrual phase started, she complained of numbness in her left lower limb. Brain MRI revealed a new cerebral infarction in the right cerebrum. The serum levels of D-dimer, CA125, and CA19–9 were decreased, and anticoagulant therapy with warfarin was initiated. Afterwards, she started to receive pseudomenopause treatment with a GnRH agonist for the adenomyosis. Ten days after initiating the GnRH agonist treatment, her serum D-dimer level improved. She continued the warfarin and GnRH agonist once a month for 6 months, and showed no recurrence of cerebral infarctions during that time. The serum levels of CA125 and CA19–9 improved after 3 months of initiating the therapy.

The patient presented with transient weakness of her right lower limb and visited the clinic 5 months after her last GnRH agonist therapy. Brain MRI revealed new multiple cortical and subcortical infarctions in the left occipital lobe and right parietal lobe. Her serum D-dimer, fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), CA125, and CA19–9 levels were elevated, and total hysterectomy would be the most effective therapy for preventing cerebral infarction recurrence. She underwent total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which was effective in not only preventing cerebral infarction recurrence but also for normalizing the serum D-dimer, FDP, CA125, and CA19–9 levels for the last 2 years.

The patient underwent a right hemicolectomy in August 2016, and both specimens from the colonoscopy and right hemicolectomy were sent for expert consultation. On pathologic review, it was noted that both perineural and lymphovascular invasion were present, and six of 14 lymph nodes harbored metastatic carcinoma. The final pathologic staging of the patient's tumor was pT3 N1 M0, stage III as per American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging Manual, 7th edition.

Treatment:
Postoperatively, treatment options were discussed with the patient, including adjuvant chemotherapy; he agreed to receive adjuvant capecitabine, given at a 25% dose reduction of 1500 mg twice daily for days 1–14 every 21 days for the first four cycles, and increased to 2000 mg twice daily for days 1–14 every 21 days for cycles five to eight as he tolerated the therapy well. The patient completed eight cycles of capecitabine and tolerated treatment well, other than mild hand and foot syndrome which developed during the last two cycles.

Follow-up:
A follow-up CT scan at 6 and 12 months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy showed no evidence of recurrent disease. A repeat colonoscopy at 1 year from original diagnosis was also negative for any malignant-appearing lesions. Surveillance with history and physical with CEA every 3 months, and CT of his chest, abdomen, and pelvis every 6 months for the first 2 years and then annually for up to 5 years is ongoing. At the current time, the patient remains disease-free at 2 years from the time of diagnosis.

Conclusion:
The patient presented with an abnormal-appearing appendiceal orifice and was diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma with signet ring cell features. He underwent a right hemicolectomy and received adjuvant capecitabine, completing eight cycles without significant side effects. Follow-up imaging studies and colonoscopy have shown no evidence of recurrent disease. The patient will continue with surveillance for up to 5 years.",,,0

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]

Patient was discharged from our hospital following treatment for right-lateral chest and back pain. The patient's medical history includes concurrent bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and total hysterectomy for right ovarian tumor.

Physical examination findings included deep-tendon hyperreflexia in the lower extremities but no muscle weakness. Blood test results were unremarkable, apart from a high serum concentration of cancer antigen 125. Imaging studies revealed a mass in the right arch of Th12 vertebral bone that protruded into the spinal canal. Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the mass revealed no evidence of malignancy.

Pathological examination of a CT-guided needle biopsy of the paraspinal lesion demonstrated papillary proliferation of epithelial cells. The neoplastic cells showed positive results for paired box 8 (PAX8), estrogen receptor (ER), and Wilms’ tumor 1 (WT1), but negative for thyroglobulin, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), progesterone receptor, S100 protein, and calretinin. Staining for P53 showed a non-mutational “wild type” pattern. It was concluded that the paraspinal lesion was a bone metastasis of transformed LGSC originating from the previous SBT/APST in the right ovary.

The patient underwent radiotherapy for the paraspinal lesion, followed by chemotherapy treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin plus bevacizumab. The treatment successfully relieved the patient's pain. Currently, the patient presents with right-sided pleural effusion and suspected metastases in the Th3 and Th4 vertebrae, 168 months after the initial surgery.

In regards to diagnosis, the patient was evaluated with physical examination, blood tests, imaging studies, and pathological examination. The patient was diagnosed with a bone metastasis of transformed LGSC originating from the previous SBT/APST in the right ovary.

Patient: 62-year-old male

Admitted: with dyspnea and chest pain

Diagnosis: Cardiac tamponade caused by metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) with pericardial effusion

Hospital Course: 

The patient was admitted with progressive dyspnea and chest pain. On examination, he had a heart rate of 136 bpm, blood pressure of 122/74 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and O2 saturation of 98% on room air. Heart sounds were muffled, and heart rhythm was irregularly irregular. Distention of the jugular veins was observed, and Kussmaul's sign was present. Although pulsus paradoxus was not observed, other physical findings were extremely concerning for cardiac tamponade. Bibasilar crackles were present on lung auscultation. Laboratory data was remarkable for a creatinine of 1.42 and INR of 3.6 (on warfarin for a history of pulmonary embolism). His electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate (RVR) and electrical alternans. Chest radiograph showed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette.

A bedside transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was obtained, which showed a large pericardial effusion with diastolic compression of the right ventricle, suggestive of cardiac tamponade, as well as mild left ventricular systolic dysfunction (see Figures and ). The patient's INR was reversed to <1.5, and he underwent emergent subxiphoid pericardial window with the removal of 700 ml of turbid, dark, bloody pericardial fluid. He had significant improvement in hemodynamics and respiratory distress. The pericardial fluid cytology and pericardial biopsy were both positive for malignancy, consistent with metastatic UC (see ).

One week after the pericardial window, the patient underwent a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which did not show evidence of metastatic disease elsewhere. Given the recurrence of UC with metastasis to the pericardium, he was started on atezolizumab. Subsequently, he was noted to have recurrent pericardial effusion suggesting failure of treatment (see ). He was then started on pemetrexed, a folate antimetabolite chemotherapy drug, for metastatic UC with plans to complete 6 cycles.

Recommendation:

The patient requires close follow-up with his oncology team to monitor response to treatment and recurrence. He should receive regular cardiovascular evaluations due to his history of cardiac tamponade. It is recommended that the patient be advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and follow-up with his healthcare provider as needed.

Discharge Instructions:

The patient was instructed on the importance of following up with his healthcare provider and oncology team. He should continue taking his medications as prescribed and should not miss any scheduled appointments. It is recommended that the patient seek medical attention immediately if he experiences any symptoms of shortness of breath, chest pain, or palpitations.",,,0

- Clinical history: ""No history of diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular disease""

Summary:
Mr. [redacted], a 37-year-old male with no prior medical history, presented to secondary-care hospital with wide complex tachycardia of two hours duration. Chest discomfort and thumping sensation were noted, and he was treated for VT in the emergency room. A single 1mg/kg dose of lidocaine terminated the tachycardia. He was referred to our center for further evaluation, where he underwent testing including normal ECG and normal serial cardiac enzymes. His coronary angiogram revealed normal coronary arteries.

An electrophysiologic study (EPS) was conducted to rule out an accessory pathway (AP). During the study, tachycardia was induced with atrial and ventricular extrastimulation, and it was determined that the earliest local ventricular activation occurred at the distal coronary sinus (CS). This suggested either VT with 1:1 retrograde atrial activation or an aAVRT involving a left free-wall AP. The tachycardia was entrained from the high right atrium (HRA), giving an atrium-ventricle-atrium (AVA) response, to differentiate the aAVRT from VT. A transseptal puncture was carried out to attain left ventricle (LV) electrogram, and RF was delivered at the spot. Tachycardia terminated in the AP within 7 s of RF application, which was continued for 62 s. Thereafter, no tachycardia was inducible. A post-ablation atrioventricular node (AVN) Wenckebach block occurred, with no induction of tachycardia or preexcitation.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 32-year-old G2P0020 female, was admitted for evaluation and management of secondary infertility. The patient had a diagnosis of unexplained infertility and underwent ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate (and HCG trigger) with timed intrauterine insemination (IUI) using her partner's sperm. In the weeks following IUI, the patient had an elevated β-hCG level and TVUS revealed a small, irregularly shaped gestational sac in the uterus.

Past Medical History:
The patient had a history of two first-trimester miscarriages, both of which were managed expectantly.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency room with diffuse lower abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. TVUS identified what appeared to be a corpus luteal cyst in the right ovary and a likely ectopic pregnancy in the left adnexa with a small amount of complex free fluid within the cul-de-sac. The patient underwent a laparoscopic unilateral salpingectomy due to the abnormal left fallopian tube with active bleeding. On pelvic survey, the right fallopian tube appeared dilated at the junction between the isthmus and the ampulla, about 3cm in diameter, without evidence of rupture or bleeding.

Plan of Care:
The patient's husband (and power of attorney) became involved with all decisions regarding the patient's plan of care. After thorough risk-benefit consideration, the decision was made to retain the right fallopian tube and proceed conservatively with MTX administration (single-dose regimen of 50 mg/m2) due to the patient's likely desire to preserve her fallopian tube. The patient had an uneventful recovery and her β-hCG values confirmed an appropriate decline in β-hCG levels after MTX injection. 

Follow-Up:
Repeat TVUS one-month following the surgery was normal without evidence of right tubal dilatation. Approximately 14 weeks after surgery, the patient had a repeat TVUS which revealed a single viable intrauterine pregnancy, which was conceived spontaneously. 

Recommendations:
The patient was discharged home with appropriate follow-up and was advised to return to the hospital for any complications. The patient was counseled on the potential risks and benefits of future conception, the possibility of repeat ectopic pregnancy, and the importance of early prenatal care.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]
Admitting Diagnosis: Heart Failure 
Final Diagnosis: Cardiac Amyloidosis

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with worsening symptoms of heart failure. A right heart catheterization showed elevated filling pressures and a Fick cardiac index of 1.6 liters/min/m2. A TEE showed severe asymmetric septal hypertrophy suspicious for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, a cardiac MRI was ordered due to low voltage on ECG and diffuse global late gadolinium enhancement of the left ventricular myocardium. The results showed severe left ventricular hypertrophy and diffuse global late gadolinium enhancement, consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. 

An endomyocardial biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. The subtype was likely wild-type ATTR or variant ATTR amyloidosis. The only extracardiac clinical finding suggestive of systemic amyloidosis was carpal tunnel syndrome. Serum and urine electrophoresis did not detect a monoclonal protein, and serum free light chain ratio was low, which significantly lowered the suspicion for AL-amyloidosis. 

Additionally, an incidental left upper lobe mass was found on the cardiac MRI, which was further characterized as adenocarcinoma on further workup. No further differentiation of the subtype of ATTR amyloidosis was pursued due to the poor prognosis of the adenocarcinoma.

The patient was started on intravenous diuretic and inotrope therapy and showed improvement during the hospital stay. 

Discharge Condition:

The patient was discharged in stable condition with follow-up appointments scheduled with the cardiology team and oncology team for further management of cardiac amyloidosis and adenocarcinoma, respectively.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 52-year-old male with a history of diabetes for 15 years, was admitted to the hospital with a change in voice and tonsillar enlargement. Physical examination revealed grade IV tonsillar enlargement on the right side and grade III tonsillar enlargement on the left side. Serology was negative for HIV, and other preoperative blood investigations were normal.

The patient underwent bilateral tonsillectomy by dissection and the snare method. On microscopy, the tonsil tissues were found to have multiple reactive follicles of various sizes, with the right tonsil having a darker germinal center. The mantle layer consisted of a monotonous population of small-to-medium sized lymphoid cells. Some of the follicles had their germinal centers completely replaced by the mantle-zone cells, imparting a nodular pattern with fairly uniform sizes.

The initial histopathological report suggested chronic tonsillitis with areas suspicious of atypical lymphoproliferative disorder. IHC was advised for confirmation, and the neoplastic cells were positive for Bcl2, CD20, CD5, and Cyclin D1. CD10, Bcl6, and CD3 were negative, thus confirming a diagnosis of MCL in both the mantle-zone and nodular patterns.

The patient was lost to follow-up as he lived far away from the hospital and wished to take further treatment at an oncology-center close to his home.

Gender: Female

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient, a 70-year-old female, was admitted to our hospital due to upper abdominal pain. Upon physical examination, left hypochondriac pain and tenderness in the upper abdomen were noted. The laboratory examinations revealed elevated inflammatory markers and biliary enzymes. The levels of tumor markers were also elevated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed a markedly dilated main pancreatic duct (MPD) 55 mm in length in the whole pancreas, and the whole pancreatic parenchyma was thinning with atrophy. Additionally, gastropancreatic fistula and splenopancreatic fistula were detected, suggesting penetration of the pancreatic tumor. Upon examination by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, four gastropancreatic fistulas were identified on the posterior wall of the gastric body and mucus discharged from the gastropancreatic fistulas. On the basis of the findings, the patient was pre-operatively diagnosed with non-invasive intraductal papillary-mucinous cancer (IPMC) of the pancreas. 

The patient underwent total pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and distal gastrectomy combined with resection of the fistulas. Considering the malignant potential based on the main ductal type with > 10 mm MPD dilatation, lymphadenectomy was also performed. Macroscopic examination of the resected specimen indicated swelling of the whole pancreas. When the resected specimen was divided, mucus swelled out, and then most of the cut surface of the whole pancreas was occupied by the dilated MPD and the mucus accompanied by atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma. The gastropancreatic fistula and splenopancreatic fistula were macroscopically identified. In the spleen, bleeding and infarction were detected in addition to the mucus penetration. Microscopic examination of the resected specimen revealed cancer cells in the epithelium of the MPD in part of the tumor. There was no sign of infiltration on the cancer cells, and the remaining part of the MPD epithelium was adenoma. At the gastropancreatic fistula and splenopancreatic fistula, no cancer cells were detected, only mucus and inflammatory cells. 

The patient did not experience any postoperative complications. The patient has remained disease-free without evidence of recurrence for 15 months.

SUMMARY:

A 70-year-old female with upper abdominal pain was pre-operatively diagnosed with non-invasive intraductal papillary-mucinous cancer (IPMC) of the pancreas. The patient underwent total pancreatectomy, splenectomy, and distal gastrectomy combined with resection of the fistulas.

The patient, a five-year-old male, presented with a history of sudden popping sensation accompanied by warmth and pressure along the base of the skull. The symptoms radiated bilaterally and lasted for a few seconds. The patient also reported numbness of the posterior tongue and difficulty speaking. These episodes were triggered by abrupt lateral movements of the head and occurred five to ten times a year. Between the ages of eleven and fifteen, the patient experienced similar symptoms while competing in fencing. As a result, the frequency of episodes increased to one to two times weekly. At the age of nineteen, during military training, the patient experienced similar symptoms following minor trauma to the head. Episodes further increased to about fifteen episodes during the combat. The patient denied experiencing any episodes in the six months that followed his discharge from service. The patient was reassured that his symptoms were not indicative of any underlying serious pathology. 

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with dysplastic enlargement of the anterior arch of C1 vertebra and mild degenerative changes of the atlantoaxial junction leading to compression of the hypoglossal nerve. The diagnosis was made based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical spine. 

Treatment and Follow up:

The patient was advised to avoid extreme lateral movements of the head that triggered his symptoms.

However, his condition deteriorated, leading to severe electrolyte imbalance, gasping, severe acidosis (arterial pH = 6.8), and GCS 4/15. The second CT scan revealed a marked decrease in the enhancement of the edematous duodenum and target sign, suggesting microvascular ischemia or necrosis.

The patient was immediately transferred to the operating room, where a midline laparotomy incision was made. Kocher’s maneuver was performed to explore the duodenum and the retroperitoneal structures. A Whipple’s procedure was planned initially, but the patient's cardiac arrest during the operation directed the plan to a damage control surgery. The overall operation time was approximately one hour and a half. To achieve a damage control surgery, decompression of the stomach was done by a red (18 French) nasogastric tube. Lastly, an open (corrugated sheet) drain was placed near the duodenum.

Despite two hours of supportive therapy, blood pressure remained 40 mmHg/pulse, leading to a cardiac arrest with asystole rhythm and patient expiration.

Impressions:

From the available data, the patient had a severe case of duodenal ischemia or necrosis after admission with abdominal pain, fever, oral intolerance, nausea, and vomiting. The possible etiologies may have been microvascular ischemia or necrosis.

Follow-up:

The patient expired during hospitalization, and the next of kin refused an autopsy.",,,1

Patient: 38-year-old female with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to Kennedy Krieger Institute one year after being diagnosed with TSC. The diagnosis was based on various TSC-related manifestations, including skin lesions, brain abnormalities, retinal hamartomas, and lung cysts. The patient underwent bilateral nephrectomy due to renal angiomyolipomas and bilateral cysts. She was indicated for lung transplantation due to progressive deterioration of lung function and was started on everolimus to manage pulmonary Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM). The patient experienced hypotension and dizziness with an increased dose of everolimus, which was managed by reducing the dose and initiating midodrine. After a period of self-discontinuation of everolimus and canceled renal transplantation surgery, worsening pulmonary function was observed, likely attributable to everolimus interruption. The patient restarted everolimus at a reduced dose and has reported amenorrhea as the only noted side effect.

CLINICAL COURSE:
The patient, a 48-year-old male, was admitted to the psychiatric emergency room with dysmorphic mood. Subsequently, he was referred to medical service to manage hyponatremia. The patient had a past medical history of lumbar spondylosis managed with intermittent nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. He occasionally consumed alcohol but denied having any history of diabetes, prediabetes, obesity, binge drinking, abdominal trauma, any offending drugs, and any procedures including endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The family history was unremarkable.
During admission, the patient experienced abdominal discomfort that worsened alongside a fever. The patient developed tachycardia and hypotension, and the physical examination was notable for mild tenderness in the epigastrium. Laboratory investigations showed increased levels of hematocrit, leukocytes with neutrophil predominance, platelets, creatinine, C-reactive protein, amylase, and lipase. An alarming laboratory finding was a severe elevation of TGs with mild AP. The diagnosis of HTG-induced AP was established.
The patient received aggressive intravenous rehydration therapy, antiemetics, opioids for pain control, and insulin to decrease TG levels. The patient's condition improved significantly, and apheresis was not performed due to the response to insulin therapy alone. The patient was discharged after his condition had improved, and he began tolerating oral feeds. Fenofibrate was initiated, and empiric antibiotic therapy was stopped due to negative blood cultures.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
HTG-induced AP.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient is advised to continue fenofibrate therapy indefinitely to prevent further attacks of AP. The patient is asked to follow a healthy diet and avoid alcohol intake. If the patient experiences any recurring symptoms, he should seek medical attention immediately.

Patient: Middle-aged female (44 years) from Recife, northeast Brazil
Date of admission: September 2015
Date of discharge: N/A

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient was admitted to a local public hospital in September 2015 for the birth of a male neonate. The neonate was diagnosed with severe microcephaly, lissencephaly, decreased brain parenchymal volume, decreased cortical mantle, and white matter together with hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. Multiple brain calcifications, colpocephaly, and gliosis in the left cerebellar hemisphere were also observed. The mother reported a febrile episode with a headache, joint pain, and rash during the first trimester of pregnancy, followed by a prenatal intrauterine ultrasound whose diagnosis was consistent with microcephaly. The neonate presented spasticity in the upper and lower limb, extreme irritability and continuous cry. 

At six months of age, the neonate was admitted to a local hospital with recurrent seizure episodes. Electroencephalography (EEG) evidenced the presence of focal frontal epileptiform discharges. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were collected and laboratory results of serum and CSF confirmed the presence of Zika virus (ZIKV) viral RNA on both samples, following a well-established laboratory protocol. No neutralizing dengue virus (DENV) antibody titers were observed. The patient was treated with clobazam (antiepileptic drug), and after two years of life, the neonate presents controlled structural epilepsy.

The presence of ZIKV RNA was further investigated in a second blood sample collected from the child at 17 months of age. ZIKV rRT-PCR was still positive, and serology was negative for arboviruses. Additionally, the presence of a high titer of ZIKV neutralization antibodies on mother's serum confirms Zika virus infection. 

The patient is being followed in a local hospital, where the main clinical evolution consists of delayed neuropsychomotor development, dysphagia, visual impairment, and double spastic hemiplegia.

The patient was admitted to the internal medicine department with symptoms of facial swelling, dyspnea, and chest pressure. The physical examination showed a slight degree of superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS), with facial edema, and edema of the upper limbs, and an abdominal-thoracic-cervical computer tomography (CT) scan was performed, which revealed a large mass in the anterior mediastinum. The diagnosis was compatible with thymic carcinoma, with unresectable stage III and mild SVCS. Induction chemotherapy treatment was planned, and the patient received three cycles of chemotherapy, after which the patient's disease stabilized. Surgical resection was not possible due to tumor infiltration into the large vessels. The patient was administered radical radiotherapy treatment, and a CT scan performed after two months from completion of radiotherapy showed stable disease and post-radiotherapy sequelae. Follow-up without treatment was started; however, the progression of the disease was observed six months later by the appearance of new pleural and pericardial implants. Palliative chemotherapy was initiated as the second line of treatment. After 16 cycles of treatment, a partial response of the disease was obtained, and tumor progression was observed with the appearance of liver metastases in December 2017. Therefore, the third line of palliative treatment was started in January 2018 with oral capecitabine and gemcitabine, and the patient received two cycles with good tolerability, awaiting re-evaluation with CT in one month.

Date of Admission: [REDACTED] | Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with a left breast mass and was admitted to the breast clinic. Upon examination, an irregular left breast mass was detected, and an ultrasound revealed a complex heterogeneous mass consistent with a chronic abscess. An ultrasound-guided biopsy was performed, and moderate growth of Staphylococcus aureus was detected through culture. Following treatment with amoxicillin and clavulanate potassium, the patient remained symptomatic, and the mass did not decrease in size. A surgical excision was performed, and a long, thin, metallic wire was found inside the cavity, which was a retained TEPW that migrated from the tricuspid and mitral valve repair procedure. The mass was excised and sent for histopathology to reveal mammary tissue with acute and chronic inflammatory cells. The patient was discharged on the same day and later seen at the out-patient clinic for a 1-year post-surgery follow-up appointment, during which there were no palpable masses or signs of inflammation.

Diagnosis/Procedures:
Left breast mass consistent with a chronic abscess due to Staphylococcus aureus infection and a retained TEPW wire from the mitral and tricuspid valve repair.

Admission Date: [date]
Discharge Date: [date]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of abdominal fullness and weight loss of 10 kg over the past year. Physical examination revealed a large elastic hard mass extending from the xiphoid to the pubic bone. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination showed a huge tumor on the uterine corpus with a number of dilated vessels observed between the tumor and the myometrium. Computed tomography (CT) examination showed no lymph node swelling or distant metastasis. Preoperative laboratory testing revealed anemia, for which blood transfusions were administered before surgery. Preoperative serum levels of CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, and LDH were within normal limits.

The patient underwent a laparotomy, where a huge tumor was identified occupying a space from the pelvis to the diaphragm with a diameter of 30 cm. A total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) and right salpingo-oophorectomy (RSO) were performed. The excised specimen weighed 7600 g. The intraoperative frozen section report for the uterine tumor was of degenerated myoma with no findings indicating malignancy.

On permanent histological examination, the tumor was mostly comprised of degenerated uterine leiomyoma. However, an area of approximately 2 cm × several mm with atypical cells showing a fine meshwork microvascular structure was observed in the blood vessel cavity, consisting of cubic, polygonal, and short spindle-shaped cells with abnormal mitotic figures indicative of malignancy. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the atypical tumor cells to be positive for ERG, CD31, and AE1/3, partially positive for Factor VIII, and negative for α-SMA, desmin, H-caldesmon, EMA, CD34, and D2-40. The final diagnosis was epithelioid angiosarcoma arising in a degenerated uterine leiomyoma.

The patient received six courses of combination adjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel, epirubicin, and carboplatin after surgery. No recurrence has been observed 10 months after the primary surgery.

The patient, a 44-year-old married woman (gravida 2), was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of recurrent ovarian cancer which was confirmed by a series of tests and evaluations. The patient had a history of undergoing concurrent right adnexectomy for the ovarian mass, subtotal hysterectomy, and left adnexectomy five years prior which resulted in a diagnosis of ovarian serous papillary carcinoma (stage IV). The uterine wall and cervix were affected by cancer tissue and the left fallopian tube and ovary were invaded as well. The patient received a series of 12 courses of taxinol plus carboplatin chemotherapy post-surgery. Two years before admission, a new pelvic mass was found by ultrasound which was cystic and solid mixed and had a size of about 6 cm × 4.6 cm. Considering the diagnosis of ovarian cancer recurred after chemotherapy, the patient did not continue to receive treatment. After six months, CT images showed that multiple nodules and masses in the abdominal cavity and pelvis had increased; therefore, the patient received two courses of chemotherapy (paclitaxel liposome plus carboplatin) again.

Upon admission, the patient’s Karnofsky Performance Scale score was 90 and an abdominal examination revealed a hard pelvic mass with unclear boundaries. The patient’s white blood cell count and hemoglobin level decreased, and degree I chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression was considered.

Several diagnostic tests were performed during the hospital course, including carbohydrate antigen 19–9, carcinoembryonic antigen, human epididymal protein 4, carbohydrate antigen 153, and carbohydrate antigen 125 which showed an increase. The patient’s premenopausal risk ovarian malignancy algorithm (ROMA) index was 99.72%, and postmenopausal ROMA index was 99.46%. CT scan showed multiple nodules and masses in the abdominal and pelvic cavity, and some lesions were accompanied by calcification. The larger mass in the pelvic cavity was 10.2 cm × 5.8 cm in the maximum section image and had an irregular shape and unclear boundaries with the surrounding bowel. Multiple lymph nodes were found on the right axilla, mediastinum, right chest wall, and retroperitoneal space. The right renal pelvis and ureter dilatation (not shown in the figures) was caused by the oppression of swollen lymph nodes.

Upon multidisciplinary team consultation, it was determined that the multiple metastatic lesions and lymph nodes could not be completely removed by reoperation. After communicating with the patient and her family, the decision was made to continue chemotherapy.

Admission Date: October 2017
Discharge Date: November 2017

The patient has been discharged after being hospitalized in the [Redacted] Medical Center for congestive cardiac failure. He is a 67-year-old man with a medical history of permanent atrial fibrillation and triple mechanical prosthetic valve replacements since 1999 for rheumatic valvular disease. He also has nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a residual left ventricular ejection fraction of 15%.

During his hospitalization, he was found to have high-grade atrioventricular block with variable ventricular escape rhythm. An electrocardiogram (ECG) performed showed atrial fibrillation with intermittent rate regularization and variable wide complex QRS morphology, which was suggestive of the same. The patient was counseled, and an urgent cardiac resynchronization therapy with defibrillator (CRT-D) device implantation via the coronary sinus was scheduled.

During the procedure, under aseptic conditions, extrathoracic subclavian venous punctures were made using fluoroscopic guidance. After numerous attempts, a straight quadripolar lead was advanced into the middle cardiac vein (MCV), and a defibrillator lead was directed into the coronary sinus. However, during the interrogation of the defibrillator lead, it was found that there were poor R-wave sensing and unacceptably high thresholds, due to which the quadripolar lead in the MCV had to be removed, and a bipolar lead was advanced into the MCV. The leads were then connected to a generator (Inogen EL ICD, Boston Scientific Corp) with the atrial port plugged.

Postprocedure device check showed satisfactory R waves, a pacing threshold, and stable impedance. The patient was reviewed in the outpatient clinic 1 month later, and device interrogation showed stable parameters with recorded episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT). The patient agreed to repeat defibrillation testing and was readmitted for this. After moderate sedation, rapid monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (MMVT) was induced, and programmed defibrillation was successful in cardioverting the patient back to ventricular paced rhythm.

A decision was made not to pursue further lead repositionings nor additional defibrillator coils or arrays in a bid to reduce defibrillation threshold. The patient was discharged in stable condition after being counseled about the care and follow up.",,,0

Diagnosis: Familiar Left-Dominant Arrhythmogenic Cardiomyopathy

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 23-year-old male, was admitted to our cardiomyopathy clinic due to repetitive ventricular ectopic beats. He had a history of myocarditis one year before, which was managed at a different hospital. At the time of admission, he was hemodynamically stable with no other symptoms. Coronary angiogram showed normal coronary arteries, while a cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) revealed a non-dilated left ventricle (LV) with low-normal ejection fraction (EF) and mid-wall myocardial edema and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE). However, the patient did not provide consent for endomyocardial biopsy. During follow-up, LV EF was found to be mildly reduced with diffuse circumferential subepicardial LGE involvement of the LV myocardium.

In order to find the underlying cause, genetic testing was performed, which identified a heterozygous variant in DSP (c.5428C>T, p.Gln1810Ter). A diagnosis of familiar left-dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy was made based on genetic testing. The patient's mother and sister were also found to have the same mutation and phenotype. All three patients started therapy with β-blocker drugs, and the proband received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to continue medication and follow up with a cardiologist. They were advised to have genetic counseling and to inform family members to get tested for the same mutation.

The patient is an 18-year-old female with a diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent chemotherapy. She developed a non-occlusive thrombus involving the celiac trunk, proximal hepatic, and splenic arteries shortly after her first administration of IV pentamidine. The patient was found to be allergic to pentamidine treatments and developed severe crippling abdominal pain, emesis, diarrhea, and light headiness followed by near-syncope. She was given a platelet transfusion for thrombocytopenia and treated with intramuscular epinephrine which yielded a positive response. 

The patient underwent a partial colectomy due to concerns regarding ischemic colitis, which was later confirmed by the pathology report that showed patchy transmural ischemic colitis. Continued treatments of IV pentamidine every 2 weeks were noted to have immediate production of a range of symptoms mostly commonly: abdominal pain, emesis, pruritus, diarrhea, and headaches. Pentamidine allergy was established, and a desensitization protocol was subsequently used. Isolated urticarial flares with each desensitization were reported without any other clinical systemic involvement.

Thrombocytopenia was noticed in the patient, and laboratory analysis of known specific antibodies to platelets were negative. With spacing out her pentamidine treatments, her platelet counts marginally improved.

The patient was enrolled in a clinical trial so the disposition is not applicable. Overall, the patient's hospital course was significant for AML, pentamidine allergy, and thrombocytopenia.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our ICU with a diagnosis of saddle PE. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered, and the patient was started on a heparin infusion for 3 days until he improved enough to be weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. He was transferred to intermediate level of care on hospital day 2. Hematology recommended indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE. However, on the day of discharge, the patient had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. Physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch and right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. An emergent head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage, but an MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma. A CT of his pelvis showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma, and hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. After speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in his right flank. In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved bilaterally, but deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed, and our patient's recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and the patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits. He was transitioned again from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin after 3 more days of monitoring. Follow-up was scheduled with neurology and hematology. On hospital day 18, he was safely discharged.

Patient: 75-year-old male with abdominal fullness and nausea

History and Physical Examination:
The patient had a medical history of hypertension and high cholesterol, and a surgical history of a right inguinal hernia repair. The patient presented with symptoms of abdominal fullness and nausea for the past 2 months. Physical examination and laboratory findings were within normal limits.

Diagnostic Studies:
Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed a well-demarcated oval isodensity mass measuring 25 mm at the tip of his appendix. Contrast-enhanced CT showed that the lesion had gradual homogeneous contrast enhancement from the arterial phase to the equilibrium phase. Abdominal ultrasonography (US) revealed a well-demarcated hypoechoic tumour with a size of 22 mm × 18 mm × 18 mm, with some cystic areas and blood flow. Colonoscopy findings were normal.

Management and Treatment:
Preoperative diagnosis indicated appendiceal neuroendocrine tumour (NET) G1 or gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumours such as GIST. Malignancy could not be ruled out, therefore laparoscopic ileocecal resection with D3 lymph node dissection was recommended. Intraoperative findings revealed a well-demarcated tumour at the tip of the appendix, with no invasion into the surrounding tissue. According to another intraoperative finding, dissecting the adhesion between the terminal ileum and the peritoneum, which was the effect of the past herniorrhaphy, was necessary. The operation was successful with a total operation time of 167 minutes and blood loss of 100 ml.

Pathology:
Pathological findings revealed a well-demarcated tumour originating in the muscular layer at the tip of the appendix. Spindle-shaped heterotypic cells proliferated in a bundle. Vascular invasion and lymph duct invasion were not observed. No tumour cells were found in the dissected lymph node. Immunohistochemical studies revealed S-100 protein positive value but negative values for KIT and CD34 which confirmed the schwannoma of the appendix.

Date of Admission:
Date of Discharge: 

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted due to mild lower urinary tract symptoms and reduced urinary flow. The patient was on feminizing hormone therapy for 6 months with transdermal estradiol and cyproterone acetate. A routine health check prompted a PSA test, which revealed a result of 2 ng/mL. A digital rectal examination showed a mildly enlarged prostate gland. An ultrasound of the prostate revealed a mildly enlarged prostate volume of 35 mL. Repeat PSA monitoring showed a decrease in PSA concentration and an improvement in urinary flow.

Past Medical History:
The patient had no family history of prostate cancer.

Clinical Impression:
The patient had mild lower urinary tract symptoms with reduced urinary flow, a mildly enlarged prostate gland, and a decreasing PSA concentration.

Treatment and Management:
There are no studies examining the effect of feminizing hormone therapy on PSA. Androgen deprivation as part of feminizing hormone therapy is associated with a substantially lower risk for prostate cancer. Individualized decisions based upon clinical history and examination should inform the need for serial monitoring for PSA velocity or imaging.

Discharge Medications:
N/A (No medications prescribed at the time of discharge)

Follow-Up:
The patient should follow up as scheduled with their primary care physician or specialist to monitor their urinary flow and PSA concentration.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with paroxysmal disturbance of consciousness, accompanied by muscle spasms, which was diagnosed as cerebral haemorrhage. The patient had experienced two previous cerebral haemorrhages between the ages of 23 and 24 years. He was transferred to the endocrinology department with multiple intracranial calcifications, acute intracerebral haemorrhage, and several unusual features.

History and Physical Examination:
The patient had a beaked nose, “bird” face, light, and sparse scalp and body hair, no obvious armpit hair or eyebrows, exophthalmos, hoarse voice, lipoatrophy, skin pigmentation, severe abdominal aortic and peripheral artery disease, cerebral haemorrhage, and erectile dysfunction. He also had decreased bone density, as revealed on plain skull x-ray imaging, and osteopenia, as revealed on bone density scans.

Diagnostic Workup:
CT angiography revealed plaque formation in, and vascular calcification of, the aortic arch, bilateral subclavian artery, brachiocephalic trunk, proximal internal carotid artery, aorta abdominalis, and arteria iliaca communis. Intracranial calcification was also revealed on CT. Vascular ultrasonography showed atherosclerosis and plaque formation in the intracranial vessels and bilateral carotid and posterior tibial arteries. Doppler ultrasonography showed mitral calcification. Blood count results showed elevated white blood cells, neutrophils, triglycerides, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and myocardial enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, as well as creatine kinase and its MB isoenzyme.

Management and Treatment:
Once-daily atorvastatin (20 mg) was prescribed, but another large cerebral haemorrhage developed 8 months post-discharge despite treatment. The patient underwent minimally invasive intracranial haematoma surgery; however, paralysis persisted.

Patient Outcome:
After genetic analysis, a missense mutation was revealed within exon 5 of LMNA (c.898G>C) that caused a substitution of aspartate 300 by histidine (p.Asp300His). There were no WRN mutations. Both parents of the patient had a normal appearance and both carried the wild-type LMNA sequence without any symptoms of AWS, cardiovascular disease, or abnormal medical history.

Conclusion:
The patient was diagnosed with Atherosclerosis-Related Systemic Small Vessel Disease, a rare disease that is closely linked to mutations in the lamin A/C, or LMNA, gene. Discharge instructions were provided, and appropriate referrals were made to specialists for follow-up care.",,,0

The patient is a 65-year-old male with a medical history of hypertension, cholelithiasis, and panic disorder. He presented with a two-year history of recurrent episodes of flushing, diaphoresis, systolic blood pressure surges up to 200 mmHg, loss of vision, headaches, palpitations, and tremors. The patient was diagnosed with a large right adrenal pheochromocytoma.

Hospital Course:
The patient was started on a high-salt diet, terazosin, and metoprolol. He was admitted one day prior to surgery with a well-controlled blood pressure of 112/70 mmHg. In the operating room, shortly after intubation and Foley catheter insertion and prior to surgical incision, the patient's blood pressure rose to 350/180 mmHg without improvement despite intravenous phentolamine boluses. Given the inability to control the patient's labile blood pressure, a decision was made to abort the operation and transfer the patient to the intensive care unit while remaining intubated. In the ICU, the patient required massive doses of intravenous phentolamine, nitroprusside, and nicardipine as well as intravenous hydration. Interestingly, his blood pressure oscillated between 60/34 and 350/186 mmHg within a matter of 2-3 minutes in a cyclical pattern. A nasogastric tube was inserted, and the patient was started on phenoxybenzamine per tube. After 72 hours in ICU, he was weaned off intravenous antihypertensives and sedatives and extubated.

Upon transfer back to the surgical ward, the patient underwent successful open right adrenalectomy three weeks later. He was hypotensive intraoperatively, requiring vasopressors. Pathology confirmed an 8 cm right adrenal pheochromocytoma without angioinvasion, extra-adrenal extension, or necrosis.

One month postoperatively, the patient was seen in the Endocrinology clinic and reported feeling overall well with no documented hypertension. He stopped all antihypertensive medications and had no palpitations, diaphoresis, flushing, headaches, or other symptoms of catecholamine excess. His 24-hour urine metanephrines and catecholamines normalized during follow-up.

Discharge Condition:
The patient was discharged with stable blood pressure and no symptoms of catecholamine excess or hypertension. He had a ST-elevation myocardial infarction three months postoperatively, requiring urgent percutaneous coronary intervention and stent placement. The patient is continuing to be followed closely by Cardiology in an outpatient setting.

Follow-up:
The patient is advised to follow up with Cardiology and Endocrinology for continued management of his cardiovascular and endocrine health. No further cardiac testing was performed during his stay. No genetic analysis was performed during his follow-up.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was referred for further evaluation due to hyperthyrotropinemia and cushingoid features that were likely caused by oral prednisolone intake prescribed for atopic dermatitis management. The initial assessment showed a prepubertal and overweight patient with a body mass index of 26.56 kg/m2 who had been previously diagnosed with mild atopic dermatitis as early as six months old. Although her atopic dermatitis was easy to manage in the past with topical emollients and corticosteroids, this became more challenging as she grew older, causing intense scratching, sleep disturbances, and a significant impact on her quality of life. Despite trying different treatments and protocols, including local and systemic drug therapeutic options, narrowband ultraviolet B phototherapy was not offered. 

The patient was then treated with calcitriol and cholecalciferol, and the therapy resulted in significant improvement after two months, with a reduction in pruritus and extent of the eczematous lesions. The dose was increased to 1 mcg x 3/day calcitriol after the six-month mark, and at 12 months, the decision was made to switch to paricalcitol after detecting an increased Ca/Cr ratio in the urine for her age. Throughout the treatment, the patient underwent regular biochemical parameter monitoring related to calcium metabolism, and the values remained within normal range.

Patient: [Name], Female, 63 years old
Date of Admission: [Date]
Date of Discharge: [Date]
Admitting Diagnosis: Palpable right axillary mass
Discharge Diagnosis: Bilateral breast cancer consisting of occult right breast cancer with axillary metastasis (TxN1M0) and early-stage left breast cancer (T1bN0M0)

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a palpable right axillary mass. A 14-gauge core-needle biopsy revealed the right axillary lymph node as a metastatic carcinoma, possibly from the breast, with positive estrogen receptor (ER) status. Breast MRI showed a 0.6-cm irregular enhancing mass in the left upper inner breast, assessed as breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) category 4C. Second-look US confirmed the mass as an invasive carcinoma of no special type, same as that of right axillary metastasis. Subsequently, the patient underwent right axillary lymph node dissection and left breast conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy. Histologic findings of cancer cells in all three lymph nodes of the right axilla were fairly different from those of cancer cells in the left breast, indicating that the metastasis to the right axillary lymph node did not originate from the left breast cancer, although both of them showed ER positivity. Metastatic cancer cells in the right axilla were also positive for gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3), suggesting that the metastasis was derived from the breast. Finally, the patient received four cycles of doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by four cycles of taxane (AC-T) chemotherapy and radiation therapy for each breast and hormone therapy.

Evaluation and Management:
The patient received prompt and appropriate evaluation and management of her right axillary mass, invasive carcinoma of no special type in the left upper inner breast, and macrometastatic lymph nodes in the right axilla. The patient underwent right axillary lymph node dissection and left breast conserving surgery with sentinel lymph node biopsy, followed by appropriate treatment based on the final diagnosis.

Hospital Course and Discharge Status:
The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged in stable condition. No recurrence or metastasis was observed 14 months postoperatively.

Follow-up:
The patient will be followed up regularly with appropriate imaging studies to monitor for any recurrence of the cancer. She will also continue hormonal therapy, as appropriate.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Involuntary movements of the bilateral lower limbs, associated with dysarthria, grinding teeth and drooling, epileptic seizures, abnormal tic-like facial movements, tongue protrusion, biting his lips, choreic, and dystonic problems, polyneuropathy, splenomegaly.

Reason for Admission: Management and treatment of involuntary movements and epileptic seizures.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was admitted for the management and treatment of his involuntary movements, associated symptoms, and epileptic seizures. The patient had been experiencing involuntary movements of the bilateral lower limbs since the age of 26 years which gradually worsened. At the age of 31, he suffered from epileptic seizures which increased in frequency. Thereafter, the involuntary movements spread to the upper limbs and orofacial automatisms appeared.

The patient was prescribed haloperidol (2 mg three times a day) and baclofen (10 mg three times a day) for 2 years for the choreic and dystonic problems, but he responded poorly to drug treatments. During the hospitalization, neurological examination revealed poor muscle tone and absent deep tendon reflexes in all limbs. Additionally, right positive babinski sign was elicited. Laboratory tests revealed elevated creatine kinase level in the peripheral blood. Acanthocytes were observed in 4% of cells on the peripheral blood smear test. Doppler ultrasound examination revealed splenomegaly. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed progressive, symmetrical, mild atrophy of the caudate heads. His 24-h continuous electroencephalography (EEG) showed generalized asynchronous theta and epileptiform activity, which mostly originated from the right temporal lobe. A nerve conduction study showed a polyneuropathy, which revealed the right peroneal nerve, right median nerve, and bilateral ulnar nerves were partly damaged. 

The patient's MMSE score was 27 indicating mild cognitive impairment, but he did not present with any psychiatric problems. The patient's father had no neurological abnormality and died from pneumonia at age 65. The patient's mother and uncle presented with mild involuntary movements and seizures, respectively, but brain MRI and peripheral blood smears were normal. Two sisters had no neurological symptoms. The family history suggested the inheritance mode of autosomal dominant. A homozygous nonsense mutation c.8823C > G (p. Tyr2941*) in VPS13A gene was identified, which was not detected in 100 healthy controls. The mutations in genes responsible for Huntington's disease and McLeod disease were screened and the results were negative.

The patient was provided with detailed information regarding his condition and prescribed medications. He and his family members were advised to seek genetic counseling for further evaluation of inherited diseases. The patient was discharged in a stable condition with the recommendation to follow-up with his primary care physician.

FINAL DISCHARGE SUMMARY

Admission Date: [REDACTED] Discharge Date: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 45-year-old female with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. Previously, the patient had received the standard of care chemotherapy treatment, which was not effective. She was enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial of combination therapy with daily cediranib and once every 2 weeks of durvalumab.

During the hospitalization, the patient developed sinus tachycardia and was found to have hazy bibasilar interstitial markings on a portable chest x-ray. Further evaluation revealed a dilated right ventricle with decreased function and an elevated right ventricular systolic pressure of 67 mmHg. Cardiac MRI demonstrated severely reduced right ventricular function with volume and pressure overload consistent with pulmonary hypertension, but no evidence of myocarditis. A CT angiogram showed a prominence of interstitial markings, the main pulmonary artery was enlarged, and the right atrium and ventricle were both severely dilated. A ventilation-perfusion scan demonstrated mismatched perfusion defects along the pleural margins that were interpreted as a high probability of pulmonary emboli.

The patient was started on therapeutic anti-coagulation for possible pulmonary emboli. However, over the ensuing 10 days, the patient's clinical condition worsened despite aggressive therapy for right heart failure that included intravenous diuresis, inotropic support, and pulmonary vasodilator therapy. Given the patient's advanced disease and poor functional status, her protocol treatment was stopped, and she was discharged home with hospice care. She died 1 day later. 

Autopsy showed metastatic carcinoma with lymphangitic spread within the septa and subpleural spaces with associated congestion and fibrosis. Pulmonary arterioles were occluded by organized thrombi, some with evidence of recanalization, as well as smooth muscle proliferation and ingrowth of fibroblasts. Some arteries showed fresh thrombi with metastatic tumor foci. Pulmonary venules were also occluded with ingrowth of fibroblasts. 

Diagnosis:

The patient had metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and developed pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM) with features of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD).

Summary:

The patient was admitted for evaluation of dyspnea on exertion and fatigue. During hospitalization, she was found to have PTTM with features of PVOD, which was a consequence of metastatic cancer. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient worsened and was discharged home with hospice care. She died 1 day later.",,,0

Patient: 62-year-old male 
Admission Date: January 2017 
Discharge Date: July 2017 
Admitting Diagnosis: Tuberculous Meningitis/Encephalitis 

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient was admitted to the hospital in January 2017 with aggravation of tuberculous meningitis. After undergoing a four-drug regimen, antituberculosis medication and steroid prescription, the patient's condition gradually improved over the course of one month. The patient was able to return to his previous job without any apparent complications. However, the patient's mental confusion and dysphasia with accompanying gait disturbance gradually developed again within four months, leading to MRI evaluation and extensive progression of diffuse leptomeningeal enhancement. 

Diagnostic Results:
The MRI showed multiple linear and nodular leptomeningeal enhancing lesions scattered in basal and left sylvian cisterns. Biopsy of the brain surface and leptomeninges was performed and histologic diagnosis revealed diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor (DLGNT) without intraparenchymal brain lesion. After histologic diagnosis of DLGNT, MRI of the whole spine was subsequently performed and showed multiple leptomeningeal enhancing nodules displaying high signal intensity on T2 weighted images, disseminating along the whole spinal cord without intramedullary lesion. 

Treatment Plan:
As DLGNT was diagnosed, PCV (Procarbazine, CCNU, and Vincristine) chemotherapy and radiation therapy of the craniospinal axis were planned. Prior to starting treatment, the patient's condition gradually deteriorated with apparent worsening of severe memory impairment, disorientation, and gait ataxia.

The patient was admitted to the outpatient clinic at the Department of Nephrology due to treatment-resistant hypertension, rapidly developing edema, and overt proteinuria. The patient had previously been followed up at the outpatient clinic at the Department of Endocrinology for poorly controlled type 1 diabetes with microvascular complications, including retinopathy and albuminuria. The patient's plasma creatinine levels had been within normal range, and hypertension was well-controlled using ACE inhibitors. However, blood pressure had increased progressively, accompanied by edema. Despite increasing doses and numbers of antihypertensive agents and diuretics, blood pressure continued to be severely elevated, combined with progressive fluid overload and proteinuria. Upon referral to the Department of Nephrology, a renography revealed no perfusion of the right kidney, and ultrasound confirmed the presence of a rudimentary right kidney. The patient was diagnosed with NS assumed to be related to diabetes.

Treatment and Outcome:

A loop diuretic was initiated to reduce blood pressure, but there was no effect on edema and blood pressure. Furosemide was then stepped up to 160 mg/day with minimal results. To address this, the ENaC blocker amiloride was initiated, resulting in the effective resolution of edema, concomitant weight loss of 7 kg, and the reduction of blood pressure. The patient was immediately hospitalized for cardiac monitoring and treatment of hyperkalemia. Amiloride and spironolactone were both discontinued. At follow-up, a combination-drug containing 2.5 mg amiloride and 25 mg hydrochlorthiazide was successfully reinitiated due to increased blood pressure and edema. At the last visit to the outpatient clinic, the patient received several antihypertensive/diuretic drugs and maintained stable body weight.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a two-year-old female with a six-week history of macrocephaly and truncal and peripheral ataxia, was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. An urgent brain MRI demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass centered within the hypothalamus/optic chiasm, with extension into the surrounding structures and mass effect on the midbrain and third ventricle causing obstructive hydrocephalus.

The patient underwent an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt to manage her hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma that was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing. She was started on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin but had rapid tumor progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy.

This progression caused the patient to develop further complications, including progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second VP shunt.

After extensive discussions and mutual expert consensus, her chemotherapy was stopped, and she was started on the novel targeted agent dabrafenib. By three months of starting dabrafenib, the size of her tumor decreased by more than 70%, with continued decline until plateauing after two years of therapy.

Prior to dabrafenib, the patient had marked motor and speech impairments but is now able to perform all age-appropriate developmental skills independently. She no longer requires tube feeding and has been growing well. Her bitemporal hemianopia has improved markedly. Her visual acuity is the only symptom that has not shown significant recovery, as she continues to have low but stable visual acuity bilaterally.

The patient was enrolled in the ORCYD biomarker study to test her plasma and CSF for the presence of the BRAF-V600E mutation and to correlate the assay results with the MRI changes observed while on dabrafenib therapy. However, the BRAF-V600E mutation was not detected in any of the samples from either plasma or CSF.

The patient was discharged in stable condition with plans to continue on dabrafenib as long as the patient is tolerating the therapy well with no recurrence or progression of the tumor.

This is a case of a 57-year-old male who presented with symptoms of progressive fatigue, dyspnoea and numbness over the soles of his feet. The patient had a history of hypothyroidism, which was discovered during his initial evaluation by his General Practitioner. Further testing showed that the patient had cardiomegaly and myopericarditis. The patient was referred to a cardiologist, who performed pericardial drainage. An ECG showed low voltage complexes and voltage criteria for left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The patient underwent post-drainage echocardiogram and cardiac MRI, which showed signs of an infiltrative process. The patient also had abnormal liver and spleen appearances, suggestive of iron overload, and extensive lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which showed significant artery stenosis. 

During the patient's evaluation, a diagnosis of amyloidosis was initially suspected but further tests were negative for the condition. The patient was evaluated by the Inherited Metabolic Diseases Unit (IMDU) due to the complexity of his clinical presentation and lack of a unifying diagnosis. The patient also underwent evaluations for polycythaemia and polyneuropathy, but no underlying cause was discovered. Blood work showed mild persistent eosinophilia and elevated ANA with speckled pattern. The patient also had severe motor-sensory axonal/demyelinating polyneuropathy. 

The patient was evaluated for mitochondrial disease, which was negative for 3243A > G mutation. Biochemistry test results showed elevated serum lactate, mild increases in excretion of tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, and slight increases in excretion of 4-hydroxyphenyllactate and 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. Additionally, acylcarnitine profile showed slight increase in hydroxybutyrlcarnitine and tetradeceneoylcarnitine. 

The patient developed further visual problems, which led to a referral to Ophthalmology Unit, where eye electrophysiology showed poor macular and central retinal function consistent with mild cone/rod dystrophy or macular dystrophy with mild pan-retinal involvement. 

The patient also presented to the Emergency Department with severe right sided hip pain and inability to weight bear. Imaging showed a significant volume of high-density material in the right iliopsoas bursa. CT-guided right periprosthetic fluid drainage was undertaken, and a diagnosis of metallosis was considered. Preoperatively, the patient's plasma cobalt concentration and chromium were found to be markedly elevated.

The patient underwent right hip prosthesis removal and his plasma cobalt and chromium concentrations declined but were still above the threshold recommended by Medical Health Regulatory Authority. The patient reported feeling better without further deterioration of his vision and peripheral neuropathy. 

Two years later, the patient's repeat plasma lactate, plasma acylcarnitines, and urine organic acids were unremarkable.

The patient was admitted to our hospital for jaundice and pruritus. Laboratory tests showed elevated blood markers, with a level of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) and total bilirubin. Additionally, the patient's serum carcinoembryonic antigen level was elevated. Computed tomography (CT) showed wall thickening in the second portion of the duodenum, dilation of the common bile duct, and swelling of the para-aortic lymph node. Upper endoscopy suggested a duodenal tumor. For obstructive jaundice, an endoscopic retrograde bile drainage tube was placed at the common bile duct. Further imaging with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT demonstrated abnormal uptake in the tumor in the duodenum.

The patient underwent chemotherapy with XELOX for six cycles to address the effectiveness of the treatment, which was followed by follow-up imaging with FDG-PET/CT or CT every 2 months. The imaging confirmed the disappearance of the metastatic liver tumor and nodal metastasis. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection and partial resection of the liver for curative intent, which showed that the lesions in the duodenum, liver, and 43 lymph nodes were not visible in the surgical specimen. Postoperatively, the histological effect was determined to be grade 3, and the patient was diagnosed as having achieved pathological complete response (pCR).

The patient suffered from grade A postoperative pancreatic fistula but was discharged from our hospital on postoperative day 32 without fatal complications. The patient received capecitabine orally for 6 months and has been disease-free for 14 months after the surgery with no evidence of metastatic lesion.

Patient Name: N/A
Date of Admission: N/A
Date of Discharge: N/A

Hospital Course:

An otherwise healthy 20-year-old female patient was admitted with complaints of lower abdominal pain with repeated remission and exacerbation lasting for three months. Tenderness in the lower abdomen with a neoplastic mass with mobility was confirmed on physical examination. Blood biochemistry revealed mild inflammation. Abdominal CT confirmed invagination of the intestinal tract inside the transverse colon, leading to a diagnosis of intestinal intussusception.

The patient was hospitalized for emergency treatment, and a colonoscopic disinvagination was attempted without preparation. Invagination of a neoplastic lesion into the cecum was confirmed, and a histopathological examination confirmed only inflammatory cells with no clear finding of a neoplasm. The possibility of a malignant tumor could not be ignored as a cause of invagination, leading to a diagnosis of appendiceal neoplasm, and surgery was performed.

Under general anesthesia, a single incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) was performed with three 5mm ports inserted in the same area. Intraoperative observation showed that the appendix had invaginated into the cecum, leading to a diagnosis of appendiceal intussusception. The tumor was probably resectable in the peritoneal cavity, but there was a risk of damaging the tumor. Therefore, the ileocecal region was extracted through the umbilical wound. With a small incision in the cecum, the intussuscepted appendix was retracted, and the cecum was partially resected with an automatic suturing device to keep the safe margin.

There were no malignant findings in the frozen section. Additional resection was deemed unnecessary, and the surgery was completed. In histopathological findings, the appendix was completely invaginated into the cecum. Because only inflammatory changes were confirmed in the appendiceal mucous membrane, there was no clear neoplastic component. The findings led to a diagnosis of idiopathic type V appendiceal intussusception.

Postoperatively, the patient's condition remained stable. There were no surgical complications. The patient was discharged on the fifth day postoperatively in good health with instructions for follow-up care and appointments with doctors as necessary.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 68-year-old female presented to the emergency department with complaints of sudden onset of shortness of breath, chest pain, orthopnea, and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. The notably past medical history includes hypertension, high cholesterol, chronic kidney disease stage 3, and hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT). Initial vital signs and laboratory investigations confirms acute systolic heart failure with markedly elevated BNP levels. Following prompt medical management, the patient demonstrated symptomatic improvement and was started on guideline-directed medical therapy including beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, aldosterone antagonist and an oral diuretic. Subsequent left and right heart catheterization reveals widely patent coronary vessels, elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. The patient continued to attend regular bevacizumab infusions with her haematologist as this was not thought to be the cause of her cardiomyopathy at the time. Unfortunately, the patient developed recurrent episodes of flash pulmonary edema deemed to be due to medication non-compliance and subsequently experienced sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath at home followed by ventricular fibrillation related cardiac arrest which required prolonged resuscitation attempts leading to therapeutic hypothermia, but eventually passed away 3 days later.

Age: 61
Gender: Male

Hospital: [Redacted]
Service: Otolaryngology

Chief Complaint:
Progressive asymmetric hearing loss and limited communication ability.

Hospital Course:

The patient was referred for hearing rehabilitation with cochlear implant on the left side due to progressive asymmetric hearing loss and limited communication ability. Word recognition score on the left side was 20% with hearing aid and 50% on the right side with FM system testing at 65 dB SPL.

A contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) revealed an intra- and extracanalicular vestibular schwannoma (VS) or acoustic neuroma. Possible treatment options included tumor removal via a retrosigmoid approach or stereotactic radiotherapy as first-line therapy. The patient underwent tumor removal via a retrosigmoid approach. Vestibulocochlear and facial nerves were preserved as their functionality was monitored with electrophysiologic monitoring (neuromonitoring). There was a small residual intracanalicular VS six months postoperatively. Subsequently, the patient underwent stereotactic radiotherapy before cochlear implantation with 13 Gy (70% Isodose; Dmax 18.6 Gy) delivered in a single session.

Six weeks later, the cochlear implant was placed more posterior than usual to minimize artifacts in postoperative MRI scans. Six months after cochlear implantation, the first postoperative MRI was performed using a 1.5 Tesla MR with medium bandwidth. One month after implantation, aided word recognition score (WRS) with cochlear implant on the left side (and masking of the right side) was 45% with FM testing at 65 dB SPL and six months later, 60%. Binaural hearing with cochlear implant on the left side and hearing aid on the right side resulted in an aided WRS of 90% with FM testing after two years.

Hearing in noise was measured with the aided Oldenburg Sentence test (OLSA). One year postoperatively, the test revealed scores of −1.1 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the left side with cochlear implant (with masking of the right ear) and −3 dB with cochlear implant and hearing aid on the right side, indicating an improvement of hearing in noise with cochlear implant.

Impression:

The patient underwent vestibular schwannoma resection via a retrosigmoid approach with preserved vestibulocochlear and facial nerves. He subsequently underwent a stereotactic radiotherapy before cochlear implantation with good hearing outcomes. The patient demonstrated significant improvement in word recognition score, binaural hearing, and hearing in noise after cochlear implantation. 

Plan:

Continue follow-up with audiology to monitor hearing outcomes. Consider MRI surveillance to evaluate recurrent/suspicious growth of vestibular schwannoma. Provide annual hearing and vestibular function assessments.",,,1

The patient is a previously healthy 3-year-old boy who presented with a 5-day history of cough and febrile illness.

Hospital Course:
The patient was diagnosed with left-sided pneumonia and received intravenous antibiotics. Due to worsening respiratory distress, he was transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) the following day. He developed acute respiratory failure, followed by endotracheal intubation and invasive ventilation. The boy's chest X-ray showed an effusion and pneumothorax on the left side which required the placement of two chest drains. Streptococcus pneumonia was isolated from the chest drain fluid and Influenza H1N1 from a tracheal aspirate via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A chest computer tomography (CT) showed a severe necrotizing pneumonia of the left lung with destruction of lung parenchyma and formation of a large abscess cavity in the lower lobe, as well as consolidation of the right lung. After a trial of high frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was implemented on day 19 of mechanical ventilation. Over the next four weeks, the patient showed basically no lung aeration, depending completely on extracorporeal support.

Management:
The patient was managed with daily prone positioning for 12-16 hours, twice daily inhalation with DNase and 2-3 toilet bronchoscopies per week to remove necrotic endobronchial material and reduce its viscosity. This led to an increase in tidal volume to 35 mL (2 mL/kg) by week five, and finally to 100 mL (6 mL/kg) on day 41, in addition to areas of lung re-aeration on CXR.

Hospital Course and Discharge:
Forty-eight hours post-ECMO decannulation, the patient's ventilation was slowly weaned. After a total mechanical ventilation time of 88 days, the patient was discharged from PICU and home 4 weeks later without additional oxygen. The patient is now 1 year post-discharge and has normal oxygen saturation in room air and has fully recovered. The latest CXR showed only small residual parenchymal changes and a thickening of the pleura of the left lung.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Giant cervical fibroid polyp mimicking incarcerated procidentia

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 47-year-old female, was admitted on [redacted] with the complaint of a huge irreducible mass protruding out of the vagina since the past two months. The patient also had a complaint of heavy menstrual bleeding and dyspareunia since last year. General physical examination, systemic examination, and per abdomen examination were unremarkable. Upon local examination, a solid fleshy pedunculated mass measuring 13 cm x 13 cm x 8 cm was observed dangling from the vaginal introitus. The surface was irregular, friable, and necrotic. The surrounding vaginal walls were hypertrophied and inflamed. The patient was immediately started on parenteral broad-spectrum antibiotics, and regular dressings of the mass were done with glycerine-acroflavin solution along with saline irrigation before the surgery.

Diagnostic Imaging:

Transabdominal ultrasound revealed a normal-sized uterus inside the pelvis with a huge protruding vaginal mass. The cervix could not be appreciated separately on the ultrasound. Subsequently, a pelvic MRI was conducted, which helped in making the diagnosis of prolapsed cervical fibroid polyp clearly. The MRI revealed a uterus that was normally placed inside the pelvis and a huge mass measuring 13 cm x 8 cm lying outside introitus originating from the cervix.

Treatment:

Upon examination under anesthesia in the operation theatre, the actual anatomy of the mass and its relationship with surrounding structures was delineated; a huge fibroid polyp was seen originating from the posterior lip of the cervix surrounded by hypertrophic vaginal walls. After amputation of the cervical fibroid polyp, normal anatomy of the cervix, surrounding vagina, and pelvic floor was identified. As the patient also had abnormal uterine bleeding and desired hysterectomy, the surgeon proceeded with hysterectomy. The intraoperative blood loss was average, and there were no intra-operative or post-operative complications. A biopsy from the surface of the mass revealed chronic inflammation along with necrosis at the surface without any malignant changes, and the histopathology of the specimen confirmed the diagnosis of leiomyoma with degenerative changes at the surface.

Discharge Condition:

The patient's condition improved after the surgery, and she was discharged on [redacted]. She is recommended to follow up with her gynecologist post-surgery.

Brachytherapy began by diluting a 32P solution with 0.9% NaCl solution to produce a radioactivity of 69.2–74.7 MBq/mL. The lesion area was covered with transparent plastic film and cellulose qualitative filter paper as a medicine film. The size of the 32P simple-drug membranes was determined using carbon paper, and the membranes were prepared by evenly applying the diluted 32P to filter paper, which was then allowed to dry. The drug membranes were removed between 48 and 72 h after application, and the membranes were properly disposed of as radioactive waste. The last treatment was in June 2010.

Follow-Up:
After the 32P brachytherapy, follow-up results over the course of 8 years were promising. The regional symptoms disappeared, the right preauricular swelling decreased, the subcutaneous nodules decreased in size, the exudate disappeared, and the skin appearance improved.

Disposition:
The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with their primary care physician and an otorhinolaryngologist.",,,0

Summary:
This is a discharge summary for a 30-year-old male patient who was admitted to the hospital with fever, non-productive cough, and exertional dyspnoea. On admission, the patient had hypertension and renal impairment, and was diagnosed with mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis three months prior to admission. Initial examination showed pancytopaenia and dysplastic hypoproliferative bone marrow, peripheral blood detected cytomegalovirus, and subsequent testing revealed positive anti-CMV IgM. Anti tuberculous therapy was commenced for disseminated tuberculosis, but the response was poor. The patient was later diagnosed with Aspergillus fumigatus on bronchoalveolar lavage wet smear and culture, and began treatment with voriconazole. Unfortunately, the patient developed acute bilateral lower limb ischaemia and underwent emergency embolectomy. Further imaging revealed a large splenic abscess and multiple small focal lesions in capsular and cortical regions, suggestive of fungal embolism, subsequently treated with liposomal amphotericin. The patient underwent elective splenectomy. The patient also showed signs of immune deficiency and impaired T cell proliferation with concanavalin A. 

Hospital Course: 
The patient presented to the hospital with fever, non-productive cough, and exertional dyspnoea. Initial examination showed several underlying medical conditions, including hypertension, renal impairment due to mesangioproliferative glomerulonephritis diagnosed three months prior, pancytopaenia, and dysplastic hypoproliferative bone marrow. Peripheral blood detected cytomegalovirus and subsequent testing revealed positive anti-CMV IgM. He was treated with ganciclovir for 21 days and ultimately showed improvement.
Later, the patient was diagnosed with disseminated tuberculosis, but treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide showed poor response. Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed Aspergillus fumigatus and treatment with voriconazole was initiated. After six weeks, the patient developed acute bilateral lower limb ischaemia and fungal embolism was detected in the emboli occluding bilateral popliteal arteries. Liposomal amphotericin was commenced for four weeks after which the patient developed acute left upper motor neuron type facial nerve palsy suggestive of fungal embolism.

- Age: 73 years old
- Admitting Diagnosis: Sore throat

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital to investigate a persistent sore throat that had been ongoing for 6 months. Previous medical history revealed a history of diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol. Upon examination, a tumorous lesion was discovered in the oropharynx at the base of the tongue and another lesion was observed in the hypopharynx with atypical blood vessel formation. Further testing was conducted, including a CT scan and PET/CT, which confirmed the presence of the lesions in the oropharynx and hypopharynx. Subsequent tissue biopsies confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in the hypopharynx and primary extramedullary plasmacytoma in the oropharynx.

Treatment:
The patient underwent radiotherapy as part of his curative treatment, with an initial dose of 40 Gy given in 20 fractions targeting the whole neck. The irradiation field was then reduced to specifically target the tumor in the hypopharynx, and an additional 30 Gy was administered in 15 fractions.

Patient Information: 
- Name: [patient’s name]
- Age: 58 years old
- Gender: Female
- Medical history: SLE-associated secondary APS, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, diet-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stage 3B moderate chronic kidney disease, fatty liver, endometrial cancer (treated 14 years ago with progesterone), left total shoulder joint replacement for severe osteoarthritis, and Sydenham’s chorea.

Hospital Course: 
The patient was admitted with ulcerative lesions on her anterior abdominal wall related to an abdominal ultrasound. She was diagnosed with secondary APS based on positive LA in two determinations with a 3-month interval and a history of recurrent deep vein thrombosis. She was started on warfarin anticoagulation and antibiotics for a period of 2 weeks. However, the patient re-presented 11 days later with worsening of her symptoms: specifically non-healing ulcers and increasing pain. Despite being on high-intensity warfarin anticoagulation and antibiotics, she reported minimal improvement in her symptoms. She had multiple subsequent admissions with sepsis and bleeding from her ulcers with worsening of renal function. Plasmapheresis and intravenously administered immunoglobulins were tried along with ulcer debridement with little response to treatment. Due to declining renal function and lack of response to apixaban, she was changed back to warfarin anticoagulation. During her last admission (6 months from the first presentation), she was found to have an infection by Staphylococcus epidermidis of her left shoulder joint prosthesis. The prosthesis was removed and she was commenced on vancomycin. This admission was further complicated by hemarthrosis of her left shoulder and rectal bleeding needing blood transfusions. A colonoscopy performed during this admission revealed bleeding hemorrhoids, which were managed conservatively. Due to recurrent bleeding and the need for repeated blood transfusions, a decision was made, after consultation with our patient, to stop anticoagulation.

Summary: 
The patient was diagnosed with secondary APS and underwent multiple admissions due to worsening symptoms despite treatment with warfarin anticoagulation and antibiotics along with plasmapheresis and intravenously administered immunoglobulins. The patient was found to have an infection of her left shoulder joint prosthesis, which was removed during the last admission. Due to recurrent bleeding, a decision was made to stop anticoagulation. Further management of the patient will require controlling the underlying APS and considering other modes of prophylaxis for thrombotic events.",,,0
2408,"Hospital Course:
The patient was a 47-year-old female with a history of ulcerative colitis, Sjogren’s syndrome, migraines, and fibromyalgia who presented with a 6 month history of left lower extremity paresthesia followed by a 2 month history of progressive headaches, imbalance, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and diplopia. She was promptly started on steroids, admitted to the hospital, and underwent a midline suboccipital craniotomy for debulking of a large intracerebellar tumor. Upon entering the cystic cavity, grossly purulent material without hemorrhage was noted, and a subtotal resection was achieved. Final pathology rendered the diagnosis of primary CNS histiocytic sarcoma.
Post-operative MRI showed continued bilateral-enhancement along multiple cranial nerves, concerning for leptomeningeal spread. A staging PET scan was performed two weeks following surgery suggesting diffuse leptomeningeal spread, which was confirmed by spinal MRI. Due to progressive lower back pain, the patient initiated radiation therapy including whole brain radiotherapy followed by a posterior fossa boost and a gross tumor boost. Interval follow up MRI showed a partial response with near-complete resolution of previous leptomeningeal enhancement. Chemotherapy with high CNS penetrating therapeutic agents including high-dose methotrexate, high-dose Ara-C, and thiotepa followed by high-dose chemotherapy with BCNU and thiotepa rescued by autologous stem cell transplantation was initiated, but was poorly tolerated after one cycle due to patient intolerance. The patient was then switched to cladribine, which was better tolerated. However, within two weeks after the completion of this infusion, the patient developed symptoms of malignant meningitis and was started on IV antibiotics.
The patient underwent further radiation therapy targeting C4-C6 and T1-T7 for new lesions consistent with metastatic disease in the untreated cervical spinal cord and thoracic vertebrae, including intramedullary involvement. The patient was then started on Dasatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with known CNS penetration, but was poorly tolerated because of nausea, diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis and was discontinued after one week. CT images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed progressive bilateral pulmonary nodules. An MRI of the spine showed persistent but significantly improved leptomeningeal enhancement.
Due to progression of symptoms, worsening systemic disease despite control of CNS disease, and limited systemic options available, the patient chose to enroll in hospice.

Past medical history:
The patient had a normal delivery 15 years ago and had no previous medical illnesses.

Clinical course:
On examination, the patient was found to have a midline palpable firm mass with mild tenderness that arose from the pelvis. The initial diagnostic imaging, including abdominal ultrasound and transvaginal ultrasound, revealed a large solid cystic mass in the right adnexa region with a cystic area and a soild component. Further CT and MRI imaging confirmed the presence of a mass in the pelvis with deviation of the uterus to the left side. The patient underwent TAH + BSO plus infracolic omentectomy, during which a freely mobile left ovarian mass was discovered with an irregular surface and an intact capsule. The patient had a smooth post-operative recovery and was discharged.

Hospital Course:
A 35-year-old female was admitted to the hospital with dysuria and pelvic pressure. She was initially diagnosed with a urinary tract infection and was prescribed antibiotics. However, her symptoms worsened, and she was seen by her primary care provider who found an abnormal cervical mass. The patient was referred to gynecology oncology for further evaluation.

Medical History:
The patient's medical history was significant for a history of loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 2/3, ESSURE placement, and chronic tobacco use.

Diagnostic Findings:
The cervical mass was biopsied, and the tissue pathology was negative for malignancy but suggested inflammation and cellular changes indicative of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The patient had external vulvar lesions concerning for HSV, which were cultured. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan showed an elevated T-2 signal, which was concerning for a potential neoplasm at the outer surface of the cervix. There were mildly prominent right inguinal lymph nodes on the MRI. The cervical, vulvar, and urine cultures all returned positive for HSV.

Treatment:
The patient was started on valacyclovir for 10 days due to suspected HSV infection. She was counseled about her diagnosis and recommended for follow-up with a general obstetrician-gynecologist in a month. A repeat pap smear was recommended in two to three years to adequately assess any cervical inflammation.

Patient: 55-year-old female with systemic lupus erythematosus.

Admission: Admitted to the haematology external consultation service with fatigue and constitutional syndrome of 5 months’ duration.

Diagnostic Imaging: Extrainstitutional CT showed multiple focal, hypovascular liver lesions with microcalcifications occupying all segments of the liver. Hospitalized for further evaluation with contrast MRI. 

MRI Findings: Liver of normal size and morphology with multiple focal lesions distributed among all segments of the hepatic parenchyma, ranging in size from a few millimetres to several centimetres. Lesions appeared hyperintense in T2 sequences and hypointense in T1 sequences without identification of a fatty component in their interior, with predominant restriction in the periphery in diffusion sequences. After contrast administration, some lesions showed discrete heterogeneous peripheral enhancement, whereas others showed intralesional nodular enhancement with very little contrast uptake even in the late 5-min sequences. Phase and out-of-phase sequences were performed without identifying change in intensity signal, suggesting microscopic fat content in the lesions. 

Ultrasound Findings: Solid, frank echogenic lesions with multiple punctate echogenic foci in their interiors, explained by the presence of calcifications. Some exhibited an annular hyperechogic halo with less echogenic centres. No alterations of the biliary tract were identified. 

Biopsy Report: Fragments of liver tissue replaced by a benign lesion of vascular origin characterized by numerous anastomosing vascular channels within it, lined by endothelial cells without atypia, separated by fibrous connective tissue septa with ectatic and obliterated vessels, findings consistent with sclerosing cavernous haemangioma.

Hospital Course:

This is a discharge summary for a 66-year-old female with infiltrating ductal cancer in the lower outer quadrant of her left breast. The patient underwent left partial mastectomy and sentinel node biopsy. The patient also had bilateral lung masses that were proven to be positron emission tomography (PET) fludeoxyglucose avid. Transthoracic core biopsy of the lung lesions revealed adenocarcinoma acinar type. The case was discussed at the multidisciplinary tumour board, and histology suggested three distinct curable primaries: T1N1 breast cancer and bilateral T1N0 lung cancers. The breast cancer was managed with partial mastectomy with sentinel node sampling, adjuvant tangential whole breast irradiation (WBI) with regional nodal irradiation (RNI), and an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole). The bilateral lung primaries were treated with stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR). The left and right lung tumors were each treated with 48 Gy in 4 fractions prescribed to the isocenter of each lung lesion, using SABR with volumetric modulated arc therapy technique. The breast and regional nodes (supraclavicular and axilla levels I, II and III) were treated to 50 Gy in 25 fractions using a field-in-field technique in a four-field beam arrangement. All three sites were treated concurrently. The patient completed all her treatments without toxicity.

The patient developed dyspnoea and cough 5 weeks post lung radiotherapy and within 1 week of completing breast radiotherapy. She did not feel her symptoms warranted therapy, and given her diabetic history, steroids were withheld. Her CT scan was consistent with post-radiotherapy changes. Pulmonary function tests showed mild restrictive defect.

This is a 26-year-old prelingually Deaf male with a prior history of Tourette's syndrome, bipolar disorder, and HIV. The patient was placed under Baker Act at a local hospital for “acting erratic and psychotic.” Upon initial evaluation, the preliminary diagnosis was “psychosis.”

Hospital Course:

Upon admission, an ASL-interpreter was called to assist. The patient became angry after discovering the truth of his hospitalization. Later, the patient reported having anxiety and physical pain attributed to his Tourette's Disorder. He had been taking carisoprodol and diazepam to help relieve his symptoms, but they were recently stopped. The family was called and stated there was questionable abuse of medications but they were adamant that he was safe for himself and others. 

Further interview excluded OCD as a diagnosis but substance use disorder remained high on the differential for his current and past behavior. The patient admitted to buying oxycodone off the street since his neurologist stopped prescribing medications due to questionable abuse. A clinical opiate withdrawal scale was performed and was only positive for minor anxiety elevation. A full medical workup was performed and excluded any medical causes to his admission.

The patient was kept for observation and discharged the next morning following positive report from staff. He was given extensive education on substance use as well as coping strategies to prevent readmissions. Upon discharge “unspecified psychosis” was given as his diagnosis.

Patient: Male, 66 years old
Admission Date: [Date]
Discharge Date: [Date]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. After embolization of an occipital epicranial pseudoaneurysm, the patient developed a non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and was diagnosed with severe triple-vessel disease. The patient underwent a successful coronary artery bypass graft operation and trans-septal bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement. However, in the postoperative period, the patient developed severe delirium and a sterile sternal dehiscence that required sternal reconstruction. The patient also developed atrial fibrillation and right hemidiaphragm elevation, which was diagnosed as diaphragmatic paralysis.

Treatment:
The patient underwent conservative management for three and a half weeks for his diaphragmatic paralysis. However, due to persistent respiratory distress and difficulty in tolerating non-invasive ventilation, right thoracoscopic hemidiaphragm plication was performed. The patient was intubated post-operatively to minimize stress on the sutures and was successfully extubated after five days. The patient's dynamic compliance improved significantly, and chest X-rays demonstrated better lung expansion on the right chest. The patient recovered and was discharged without any further respiratory distress or complications.

Follow-Up:
The patient underwent pulmonary function testing after five months and three years following the diaphragm plication, which revealed that his lung function had improved and remained stable. The patient also underwent a follow-up echocardiogram, which demonstrated a well-functioning mitral bioprosthesis and normal left ventricular function. The patient was discharged in a clinical functional class 1 (NYHA) and will continue to receive follow-up care as an outpatient.

Summary:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary artery disease. Following a complex series of interventions, including coronary artery bypass graft operation and trans-septal bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement, the patient developed several complications. However, the patient responded well to treatment, including hemidiaphragm plication, and ultimately recovered successfully. The patient underwent follow-up testing to assess his lung and cardiac function, and was discharged with a good prognosis.",,,0

Patient: Eight-year-old, female intact Golden Retriever

Chief Complaint: Urinary and faecal incontinence, chronic vaginal discharge

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar-sacral region under general anesthesia due to urinary and faecal incontinence, along with chronic vaginal discharge. Preanesthetic examination revealed the patient to be in good physical condition but slightly nervous (ASA II). The induction of anesthesia was achieved with fentanyl and propofol, followed by maintenance with isoflurane in 100% oxygen. Shortly after the commencement of isoflurane administration, the patient exhibited a gasping breathing pattern with a respiratory rate of 40-50 bpm and jerk movements in all four limbs. Indications of an underlying pulmonary disease appeared, and MRI was cancelled while thoracic radiographs and arterial blood gas analysis were performed. The patient was allowed to recover from general anesthesia. On the second day, preanesthetic assessment was unremarkable, and the patient was administered Dexmedetomidine and methadone slowly intravenously. When connected to the breathing system again, the patient exhibited gasping and jerking continuously, and hence, isoflurane was immediately turned off with the breathing system flushed with pure oxygen. Anesthesia was then maintained with a constant rate infusion (CRI) of propofol after slow administration of a loading dose. The patient's breathing pattern did not improve, and atracurium was administered intravenously to maintain eucapnia. The rest of the anesthetic time was uneventful, but hiccups restarted as soon as neuromuscular function started to return. An extensive invasive sacrococcygeal neoplasia was found on MRI. The owner decided to euthanize the dog, but a postmortem examination was declined.

History of Present Illness:
The patient, a 42-year-old Chinese man, presented to the outpatient clinic complaining of right ear discharge accompanied by discomfort for 3 years. The patient had a history of seawater contact and noticed a small volume of clear drainage from both ears. As the condition progressed, the drainage from the left ear vanished and the drainage from the right ear increased and became a thick, purulent exudate containing debris. The ear canal became obstructed by the thick excretion, which caused the patient to experience mild hearing loss, coupled with intermittent tinnitus, and a sensation of ear fullness. The patient did not use any medications to relieve symptoms, but instead removed debris from the right ear using cotton swabs, which resulted in a return to normal hearing and relief of symptoms. Within a few days, new thick drainage would obstruct the ear canal causing the symptoms to reappear. The patient sought health care twice at local hospitals in Xi’an City from Shaanxi Province; however, the underlying illness remained unidentified and did not improve. The discharge from the right ear gradually reduced and turned from brown to white until March 2018, when a low-concentration hydrogen peroxide solution was used to rinse the right ear canal at a local hospital.

Past Medical History:
The patient denied any history of infectious diseases, diabetes, or any immunocompromising condition.

Physical Exam:
The patient underwent audiometric and otoscopic examinations as well as radiological examinations using computed tomography imaging to examine the temporal bone. The exudate was collected from his right ear using a sterile swab and was transferred to the clinical microbiology laboratory for examination.

Diagnostic Studies:
The exudate from the right ear was analyzed by the clinical microbiology laboratory. All specimen processing and bacteriological analysis procedures were performed with approval from the ethics committee. The patient provided written informed consent prior to participation in this project.

Assessment and Plan:
The underlying illness causing the right ear discharge and discomfort was not identified, despite seeking health care twice at local hospitals prior to presentation at our clinic. Further testing and evaluation will be needed to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. 

Summary:
The patient presents with a history of right ear discharge and discomfort for 3 years, which was not resolved after seeking health care twice at local hospitals prior to presentation at our clinic.

Before the surgery, several modalities were monitored, including electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index monitoring. The anesthesia was induced with propofol and rocuronium, and intra-arterial cannulation was performed for continuous blood pressure monitoring. During surgery, the patient experienced a drop in oxygen saturation levels from 93.1% to 83.1%. The patient was ventilated at a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.4, and the arterial blood gas showed that the partial pressure of oxygen dropped from 161.6 to 51.2, which suggested atelectasis due to a collapsed lung. Treatment included increasing the positive end expiratory pressure to 10 cm H2O and FiO2 to 1.0 and performing a recruitment maneuver. The patient's oxygen saturation level increased only temporarily and dropped again to 81%. To address this, muscle relaxation was reversed, and spontaneous respiration was induced. The oxygen saturation level recovered to 90%, and the surgery continued. 

Discharge Summary:

The patient, having undergone surgery, was monitored for her vital signs and underwent various modalities (electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry, and bispectral index monitoring) prior to the procedure. Unfortunately, the patient suffered a drop in oxygen saturation levels during surgery, which was due to atelectasis (a collapsed lung). The medical team administered adjustments to the patient's ventilation parameters and was able to recover the oxygen saturation level temporarily. However, to fully address the issue, muscle relaxants were reversed, and spontaneous respiration was induced. This led to a recovery of the oxygen saturation level. After the surgery, the patient recovered and was discharged.",,,1

Hospital Course:

The above-mentioned patient, a 60-year-old African-American male, was admitted to the hospital with complaints of worsening abdominal pain and significant weight loss. On physical examination, scleral icterus was noted with mild abdominal tenderness. Laboratory investigations revealed anemia, renal failure, hypercalcemia, lipase elevation, alkaline phosphatase elevation and total bilirubin elevation. MRI of the abdomen showed a mass at the head of pancreas obstructing the biliary system. EUS showed a hypoechoic mass and FNA sampling with a 22G needle revealed atypical plasma cells consistent with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma, which was confirmed with cytology and bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemistry.

The patient received radiation and chemotherapy for pancreatic plasmacytoma and multiple myeloma, respectively. Unfortunately, the multiple myeloma did not respond to the therapy and further complications like malignant ascites and pericardial effusion developed. Despite the attempts to manage the condition with chemotherapy, the disease was refractory, and the patient passed away 10 months after the initial diagnosis.

Medical History:

The patient is a 43-year-old male with a medical history significant for hepatocellular carcinoma who underwent liver transplantation from a living donor.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for severe acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain. Continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 μg/day was started to control abdominal pain. The fentanyl dose was increased according to pain intensity, reaching 2400 μg/day (MED 240 mg/day) after 10 days in the hospital. Administration of a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid alleviated the pancreatitis and abdominal pain.

The patient subsequently developed nausea/vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation of continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion. Continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion of 240 μg/day was resumed, and these symptoms disappeared.

The patient was then switched to a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. Pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later, and therefore, continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion was resumed, titrated to 600 μg/day. The dose was gradually decreased daily (600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 μg/day).

Once the pancreatitis had improved, the fentanyl could be discontinued without causing withdrawal symptoms. The discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.

Final Diagnosis:

Severe acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain secondary to hepatocellular carcinoma and liver transplantation.

Summary:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for severe acute pancreatitis with severe abdominal pain, and continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl was initiated to control the pain. The patient experienced withdrawal symptoms after discontinuation of the fentanyl infusion, and therefore, a transdermal fentanyl patch was initiated to taper the opioid more slowly.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with symptoms of back pain, diffuse myalgia, asthenia, and fever. She was hypotensive even after fluid resuscitation and required norepinephrine infusion. A small skin defect on the left ankle was noted which was related to initial trauma. Laboratory tests showed elevated plasma C-reactive protein and procalcitonin levels, the absolute neutrophil count of 1.4 G/L with increased band forms, thrombocytopenia and very elevated creatine kinase levels. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock and was given empiric antibiotic therapy. A CT scan of the limb did not show radiologic signs of necrotizing fasciitis.
The patient subsequently developed signs of arthritis of both ankles and the right elbow, which required surgical lavage. Synovial fluid and blood cultures came back positive with group A streptococcus (S. pyogenes), and the antibiotic therapy was deescalated for high-dose IV penicillin G.
Despite the initial acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis, the patient did not need renal support therapy during the ICU stay and recovered without any major complications. The patient was transferred to the ward after 6 days and was discharged in a stable condition.

Blood pressure was also elevated at admission but normalized without additional medication.

Computed tomography showed multiple small lymphadenopathies, bilateral pleural effusion, and ascites. Laboratory findings were remarkable for severe thrombocytopenia, elevated serum creatinine and C-reactive protein, proteinuria, and microscopic hematuria.

After three days of initial pulse therapy with methylprednisolone followed by prednisolone, the patient's thrombocytopenia, anasarca, and kidney damage remained refractory. Plasma exchange was initiated but a clinical response was not achieved. The patient was then diagnosed with TAFRO syndrome and started on intravenous rituximab which dramatically improved the symptoms.

The patient was discharged from the hospital after nine months of remission and the discontinuation of her corticosteroid therapy. Her ADAMTS13 activity increased to 73.6%, and the ADAMTS13 inhibitor remained undetected.

FOLLOW-UP:
Follow-up with the patient is recommended to monitor for any recurrence of symptoms. The patient was advised to continue taking low-dose corticosteroids (PSL 5 mg/day) until her follow-up appointment.",,,0

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Medical Record Number: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with severe dyspnea and a history of lymphocytic myocarditis. The patient's comorbidities included stage III chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic gastritis, and Hashimoto thyroiditis. The patient had received an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in 2009 and a cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) system in 2012. Despite optimal medical treatment, the patient's dyspnea and quality of life had severely worsened, with a progressive left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) reduction and left ventricular (LV) dilation over the years.

The patient was enrolled in the waiting list for heart transplantation and underwent a CardioMEMS™ implantation in the beginning of 2017. Within the first three months, the patient underwent two diuretic dose adjustments and a month later, the CardioMEMS™ documented a rise in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), 34/24/17 mmHg. The patient was then admitted to the hospital.

Diagnostic Testing and Therapeutic Interventions:
A transthoracic echocardiogram showed the patient's long-standing dilated cardiomyopathy picture with severe global LV hypokinesia and an ejection fraction of 30%. After excluding any potential cause accounting for the acute presentation, the patient received a 24-h infusion of calcium sensitizer levosimendan. At hospital discharge, the patient's basic hemodynamics improved, as shown by a drop in estimated systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance and an increased cardiac output. Pulmonary artery mean pressure at one week dropped after levosimendan infusion.

A single-beat view of the PAP before and after levosimendan administration clearly showed a decreased pulmonary mean pressure, as well as a decreased pulmonary pulse pressure at an unchanged heart rate. However, despite the initiation of an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) that replaced the ACEI, a quick relapse and rise in PAP was observed. Given clinical and hemodynamic worsening despite Levosimendan administration and heart failure therapy optimization, LVAD-Implantation was indicated. A few weeks later, the patient underwent a LVAD Heart Mate III implantation as a bridge to heart transplantation. The procedure was uneventful and the patient was discharged home. 

Outcomes and Follow-up:
Since LVAD-implantation, the patient's NYHA class improved to class II and her hemodynamic parameters have stabilized at lower pulmonary pressures over 7 months.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Dilated cardiomyopathy, NYHA class III-IV with severe LV systolic dysfunction, history of lymphocytic myocarditis, CKD stage III, chronic gastritis and Hashimoto thyroiditis.

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient should have regular follow-up appointments with the cardiology team to evaluate her hemodynamics and NYHA class. The patient should also be monitored for any signs of device malfunction or infection related to the LVAD Heart Mate III. In addition, the patient should be advised to continue taking medications as prescribed and to follow a heart-healthy lifestyle.

Medical Record Number: Not mentioned

Admission Date: Not mentioned
Discharge Date: Not mentioned

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a temporary condition where the heart muscle becomes weak or stunned, often triggered by extreme physical or emotional stress.

Medical History:
The patient had a medical history significant for high cholesterol, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The patient also had a family history of coronary artery disease.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department with chest pain and shortness of breath. On examination, vital signs were stable except for low oxygen saturation on room air. Initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia, and a urine drug screen was positive for opiates, benzodiazepines, and tetrahydrocannabinol.

The patient was started on intravenous nitroglycerin and beta blocker, but became hypotensive and was given intravenous fluids and started on a norepinephrine infusion. Repeat electrocardiogram showed suggestive T wave inversions, and the patient was taken for cardiac catheterization immediately.

Cardiac catheterization revealed minor coronary artery disease and severe apical hypokinesia with a left ventricle ejection fraction of 25-30%. As a result, an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed for cardiogenic shock. The patient was started on carvedilol, captopril, and heparin infusion. She developed pulmonary edema and was subsequently started on furosemide. Echocardiogram showed severe left ventricular dysfunction. The patient continued to improve and was discharged home.

Follow-Up:
Two weeks after discharge, the patient's symptoms had improved. Repeat echocardiogram showed improved left ventricular ejection fraction. The patient was gradually started on low doses of carvedilol and lisinopril. Follow-up with a cardiologist was recommended.

Summary:
The patient presented to the emergency department with chest pain and was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She suffered cardiogenic shock, mild coronary artery disease, and severe apical hypokinesia. The patient was discharged home two weeks later with improved symptoms and was prescribed carvedilol and lisinopril. Follow-up with a cardiologist was recommended.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The 13-year-old presented with complaints of nausea, non-bloody, non-bilious vomiting, and abdominal pain. Examination revealed dehydration and acute otitis media with rupture of the tympanic membrane. She was diagnosed with gastroparesis secondary to a nonspecific viral infection and possible mild pancreatitis. The patient was admitted and treated with IV fluid support and bowel rest. Her NG tube was successfully removed, and she was discharged home tolerating a regular diet.

Two days later, the patient returned with recurrence of her prior symptoms along with scattered crackles and diffuse nodular lesions. Laboratory results revealed a relatively increased white blood cell count with significant worsening of her renal function. Respiratory viral screening was positive for rhino/enterovirus. Repeat CT imaging showed persistent gastric dilation and splenomegaly. Skin biopsies of multiple lesions were obtained and sent for pathology and culture.

An upper gastrointestinal study was performed which suggested gastric volvulus. The patient proceeded to gastropexy via open gastrostomy tube placement. Biopsies of the skin lesions confirmed the presence of many AFB with changes consistent with lepromatous leprosy due to M. leprae. Sputum samples were positive for AFB, and culture of the skin sample for AFB showed evidence of growth within a few days, suggesting Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) pulmonary infection and possibly disseminated MTB given selectivity of the culture medium.

In coordination with the health department and the infectious disease service, the patient was initiated on treatment for presumed disseminated MTB, noting that this would also provide coverage for M. leprae. Gradually, the patient's oral intake improved. With hydration, her renal function again returned to normal. She was discharged to complete therapy through the health department. Symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction have not returned.

Diagnosis:
1. Lepromatous leprosy due to M. leprae
2. Gastric volvulus

Patient: [Name], 53-year-old male of Puerto-Rican origin

Diagnosis: Pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma 

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with persistent hematuria, urinary frequency, weak stream, and nocturia. CT urogram indicated bilateral, irregular, heterogeneous large adrenal masses. Biochemical characterization of masses showed significantly elevated 24-hour urine normetanephrine, leading to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Negative symptoms included flushing, headaches, sweating, palpitations, anxiety, blurry vision, or dizziness, and no history of adrenal tumors, hyperparathyroidism, medullary thyroid cancer, renal cancer, or pituitary tumors. Ultimately, the patient underwent an open bilateral adrenalectomy and paracaval lymph node excision.

Pathology:
Surgical pathology confirmed pheochromocytomas in the bilateral adrenal glands. The paracaval lymph node was described as paraganglioma versus metastatic pheochromocytoma.

Genetic testing:
The patient was offered genetic screening for familial paraganglioma syndromes. With the patient's informed written consent, genomic DNA was isolated from a peripheral blood sample and targeted gene sequencing was performed using PGLNext. The patient was found to have a heterozygous germline mutation, c.524A>G in the VHL gene, corresponding to the Y175C substitution in the protein. This was identified as a likely pathogenic variant and confirmed by Sanger sequencing.

Treatment:
The patient required vasopressor support and a large amount of crystalloid resuscitation to maintain hemodynamic stability. Intraoperative ultrasound was used to identify one mesenteric lymph node of mildly suspicious appearance which was resected, in addition to a large retroperitoneal paracaval lymph node. The patient was started on life-long glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement.

Outcomes:
The patient's diabetes and hypertension resolved.

Follow-up:
Due to the multifocal nature of the pheochromocytomas and the presence of first-degree relatives likely to be affected, the patient was offered further genetic testing for familial paraganglioma syndromes. 

Overall, the patient's hospital course was unremarkable.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The four-year-old female patient was admitted to our tertiary care pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a diagnosis of cardiorespiratory failure. She was intubated and started on mechanical ventilation shortly after admission. The patient had a history of asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia (Jeune syndrome) and end-stage renal disease with a post-renal transplantation. She was chronically on immunosuppressive medications for ongoing renal rejection. Additionally, she was receiving peritoneal dialysis for renal failure and was recently started on dapsone for Pneumocystis prophylaxis. During her 3-week hospital stay, she developed several complications, including sepsis, electrolyte imbalance, and thrombocytopenia. She was prescribed with several medications, including fentanyl, midazolam, mycophenolate, prednisolone, pantoprazole, cefepime, and dapsone. 

On the third week of her admission, the patient developed diarrhea and metabolic acidosis. She was further noted to have cyanosis and low oxygen saturation levels (82%-87%) despite the escalation of inspired oxygen levels to 100%. The patient underwent blood gas analysis, which was consistent with metabolic acidosis and thus prompted a suspicion of methemoglobinemia. Co-oximetry was ordered, and the result showed a methemoglobin level of 21.5% (normal range is 0% to 2%). Hemolysis was ruled out upon conducting laboratory workup. As the patient had end-stage renal disease, methylene blue was contraindicated. As a result, daily ascorbic acid was administered orally via a gastrostomy tube, and dapsone was discontinued. Serial methemoglobin levels on co-oximetry showed an improvement trend. Within 48 hours, the methemoglobinemia resolved, and the level came down to 0.4 mg/dL. The patient continued to receive ascorbic acid for four more days, after which it was discontinued. Following discontinuement of ascorbic acid, the methemoglobin level remained less than 0.3 mg/dL. 

After a thorough review of the patient's medications and workup, it was determined that dapsone was the probable cause of methemoglobinemia. In light of this, the patient was prescribed with pentamidine nebulization for Pneumocystis prophylaxis.

At the time of discharge, the patient's cardiorespiratory function had significantly improved, with a stable methemoglobin level. Further follow-up care is warranted, given that the patient has a history of asphyxiating thoracic dysplasia, end-stage renal disease, and chronic rejection with ongoing use of immunosuppressant medications.

Medical History:
The patient was admitted to the emergency room with left buttock pain. The patient had a history of being a hepatitis B virus carrier. There was no remarkable medical history except for two weeks of left buttock pain.

Hospital Course:
The patient had a generalized fever up to 37.8°C, and tenderness and swelling on the left buttock and proximal area of the posterior thigh. Plain radiography showed no evidence of fracture around her hip joint. The emergency medicine physician had a clinical impression of early stage cellulitis or contusion of the hip. The patient was discharged with empirical antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications.

One week later, the patient visited the orthopedic outpatient department with aggravated pain and weakness on her left lower extremity. A patchy erythematous rash with sharp pain existed on the left buttock and posterior thigh without any sign of vesicle formation. The blood laboratory test showed mildly elevated CRP and normal procalcitonin levels. Lumbosacral MRI was urgently performed. The MRI revealed mild bulging disc with bilateral facet arthritis at L4-5 level which was not thought to be the direct cause of the symptoms. The result of EMG-NCV tests showed severe left sciatic neuropathy that no motor nerve responses from the left peroneal nerve and reduced compound muscle action potential on the tibial nerve were found. Pelvis MRI with contrast enhancement revealed asymmetrical diffuse swelling of the left sciatic and femoral nerve, which suggested neuritis. Herpes zoster infection of the left buttock three years ago was discovered in thorough systematic review. The putative diagnosis of herpes zoster was confirmed by detecting VZV DNA in her blood sample using the polymerase chain reaction test. 

Treatment:
The patient was treated with famciclovir 500 mg every eight hours and 20 mg/day of prednisolone for two weeks and changed to oral pregabalin 75 mg every 12 hours thereafter. After 12 weeks of an inpatient rehabilitation admission, the patient had a partial neurological recovery and could walk with a foot drop splint. The manual muscle test showed that muscular strength of her left ankle dorsi-flexor, plantar-flexor, and great toe extensor improved to grades II, III, and III, respectively. The hypoesthesia of S1 dermatome was completely recovered, while L4, L5 dermatomes showed 50% improvement. The skin rash and pain around it were completely alleviated.

Sex: Male

Hospital Course:

The patient, an 11-month-old Japanese baby boy, was admitted to our institution with a fever, weight loss, and gallop rhythm. He had a persistent fever of three days before presenting to the hospital. Upon examination at presentation, he appeared ill, and there was a notable S3 gallop and systolic murmur at the apex, along with cardiomegaly. Echocardiography showed an enlarged and dysfunctional left ventricle with moderate mitral regurgitation and slight aortic regurgitation. Blood tests indicated high white blood cell count and C-reactive protein levels, and brain and human atrial natriuretic peptide levels were elevated, along with serum troponin T. 

The patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy, and treatment with diuretics was initiated. However, his fever and high blood pressure persisted even after treatment, leading to further diagnoses of thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, severe celiac artery stenosis, and bilateral renal artery stenosis. These findings led to the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis (TA), and prednisolone therapy was initiated. The patient's fever resolved after five days, and his C-reactive protein levels returned to normal after ten days. 

Despite clinical improvement, the patient's vascular lesions deteriorated, as evidenced by echocardiography, which showed celiac artery occlusion, severe right renal artery stenosis, and new superior mesenteric artery stenosis on day 15. The patient's prednisolone dose was increased, and continuous intravenous infusion of lipo-prostaglandin E1 was initiated to suppress angiostenosis' progression. Vascular echocardiography was performed twice a week, and angiostenosis' progression did not occur following the initiation of lipo-PGE1.

Admission Diagnosis: Angiosarcoma of scalp.

Hospital Course:

The patient, an 83-year-old female presented to the emergency department with a large ulcerated and necrotic bulging lesion on her forehead, along with ill-defined, dusky erythematous plaques extending on the parietal and frontal areas of the scalp and the face, and violaceous-darkish nodules. Bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy was present on physical examination. The patient had comorbidities including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, diabetes, and ischemic encephalopathy.

Diagnostic workup revealed a full dermal proliferation of irregular anastomosing vascular channels lined by single or double layers of enlarged endothelial cells, with a confirmed immunoreactivity for CD31, CD34 and ERG, leading to a diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the scalp.

Total body computed tomography (CT) showed cervical lymphadenopathy without brain or visceral metastases.

Although radiotherapy and electrochemotherapy were considered, they were not performed due to the patient’s advanced age, comorbidities, and tumor size. The patient's family provided photographic documentation of the lesion evolution. The lesion had emerged four months before admission, as a 2 cm bruise-like patch on the forehead, and had rapidly developed into a large purplish plaque after 1 month, then to the current presentation.

Hospital Course:
The patient was initially admitted under haematology for pyrexia of unknown origin. Upon admission, he reported bilateral visual impairment without any accompanying symptoms. A dilated fundus examination showed bilateral and symmetrical retinopathy with cotton wool spots and retinal haemorrhages across the posterior pole with relative sparing of the peripheral retina. A Cystoid macular oedema was noted in both eyes. An urgent AC tap was arranged, which was negative for CMV, HSV, VZV, and EBV DNA; hence viral retinitis was ruled out. Given the persistent visual impairment and without an obvious infective aetiology, cyclosporine was stopped and oral steroids were commenced under the haematology guidance. Vision subjectively started to improve over the subsequent 3-4 days despite no resolution of cystoid macular oedema, and macular oedema was completely resolved over several months.

Outcome:
Although the patient's visual impairment significantly improved, his systemic health deteriorated and he died as a result of pulmonary complications over the course of the subsequent few months.

The patient [name redacted] was admitted to our hospital with a 2-month history of fever, decreased appetite, and nonproductive cough. Despite being prescribed antibiotics for presumed community-acquired pneumonia a few weeks prior to admission, his cough and fever continued to worsen. 

Upon admission, he presented with fever, tachycardia, respiratory distress, and splenomegaly. Further laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia, and a sputum gram stain showed gram-positive cocci. HBsAg and Anti-HCV and Anti-HIV were negative, and ANA, Anti ds-DNA, p-ANCA, and c-ANCA were requested but all showed negative results. Chest X-ray and CT-scan of the thorax showed bilateral and peripheral nodular and alveolar patterns, predominantly in the lower lobes of the lung, with no mediastinal lymphadenopathy or pleural effusion observed. Abdominal sonography and CT showed observed hepatosplenomegaly, with splenomegaly being more pronounced than hepatomegaly. Para-aortic lymphadenopathy was not observed.

Two days after admission, the patient was observed to have a few small brown nodular lesions on the left leg, which necessitated the removal of a skin excisional biopsy. Meanwhile, his condition continued to worsen, with the onset of right hemiplegia, seizure, and aphasia one day later. A brain CT scan revealed a broadly hypo dense area on the left temporal and basal ganglia with little enhancement post-injection of IV contrast. The resulting skin biopsy showed severe infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes, with atypical lymphocytes observed on the subcutaneous and deep parts of the dermis. The primary aggregation of the cells was found around the vessels and nerves and appendices of the skin.

Patient Identification:
The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a history of abdominal pain and aortic pseudoaneurysm resulting from Takayasu's arteritis (TA).

Hospital Course:
The patient was initially seen in the general surgery outpatient department with intermittent right abdominal pain. Abdominal ultrasonography showed no abnormalities, and no specialized treatment was given. Five days later, the patient presented to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain. A CT scan showed an aortic pseudoaneurysm, and the patient was admitted to the department of surgical oncology. An emergency aortic stent implantation and aneurysm embolization were performed. The patient was then transferred to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further treatment. Nicardipine hydrochloride and metoprolol were introduced to lower the patient's BP. Subsequently, the patient was transferred to the department of rheumatism for treatment. On May 9, treatment with prednisolone was initiated (48 mg daily). Six months after the initial presentation, he was doing well clinically with no additional vascular involvement, and his BP was stable.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with TA based on his medical history, physical examination, and auxiliary examination results.

Laboratory and Imaging:
Routine blood examination showed a white cell count of 14.71 × 109/L with 67.2% neutrophils and C-reactive protein of 59.65 mg/L. An abdominal CT scan depicted a retroperitoneal occupying lesion in the upper abdomen accompanied by an abdominal aorta dilatation. Laboratory tests showed a white cell count of 9400/μL with 62.8% neutrophils, CRP of 46 mg/L, and ESR of 23 mm/h. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the aorta showed an aortic pseudoaneurysm.

Patient: 53-year-old male

Diagnosis: Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma

Hospital Course:
The patient presented in September 2009 with a right gluteal mass, and biopsy confirmed the presence of extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma. He received neoadjuvant radiation treatment followed by wide local excision. In October 2012, he was found to have a left lower lobe lung nodule that was consistent with his history of EMC. The nodule was close to the diaphragm, and hence biopsy was not feasible. The patient underwent a left lower lobectomy, which confirmed the nature of the nodule. Post-surgery imaging showed multiple pulmonary nodules that increased in size over time. Despite consultations with many experts, the patient opted for a watchful waiting approach. Since August 2013, routine surveillance imaging showed progressive but slow growth of the multiple pulmonary nodules along with the appearance of new nodules. However, the patient remained asymptomatic.

Hospital Stay:
The patient stayed in the hospital for observation and monitoring of his pulmonary nodules.

Treatment:
The patient did not receive any treatment during his hospital stay.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with complaints of hematuria, increased frequency, and burning sensation during micturition, accompanied by left flank pain. He had a history of generalized weakness, weight loss, and loss of appetite over the past two months. On examination, a palpable left-sided abdominal mass was detected. The ultrasound of the abdomen showed the presence of a right ectopic kidney and left-sided hydronephrosis. The contrast-enhanced computerized tomography (CECT) of the abdomen revealed L-shaped crossed fused renal ectopia, a left-sided renal mass, and a polypoidal mass in the urinary bladder. 

The patient underwent a transurethral resection of the bladder lesion, which showed noninvasive papillary urothelial carcinoma. The previous diagnosis of multifocal transitional cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma (RCC)- mucinous adenocarcinoma variant with multifocal spread, and renal sarcoma was ruled out.

The patient then underwent surgery for resection of the renal mass, and a left nephrectomy with partial right nephrectomy was also performed. Post-operative results showed that the capsule was intact, and the patient had an uneventful recovery.

The patient was discharged after an appropriate follow-up and was advised to come for regular check-ups.

Hospital Discharge Diagnosis:

Primary chondrosarcoma in crossed fused renal ectopia involving both moieties.

Significant Findings:

- Ultrasound of the abdomen showed the presence of a right ectopic kidney and left-sided hydronephrosis.
- CECT of the abdomen revealed L-shaped crossed fused renal ectopia, a left-sided renal mass, and a polypoidal mass in the urinary bladder.
- Histopathology examination showed chondrosarcoma, marked pleomorphism and mitotic activity along with areas of chicken-wire calcification and hemorrhage.

Treatment Provided:

- Transurethral resection of the bladder lesion.
- Surgery for resection of the malignant renal mass, and a left nephrectomy with partial right nephrectomy was performed.

The patient is a 28-year-old African American female who presented to the emergency department with right-sided pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, and menorrhagia. Upon examination, the patient had stable vitals, and her chest exam revealed absent breath sounds on the right basal region. Initial laboratory studies revealed a severe microcytic anemia with a normal coagulation profile. Her initial chest X-ray showed right pleural effusion and airspace disease while computed tomography (CT) of chest identified a large right pleural effusion. Ultrasound of the pelvis revealed approximately 6 cm fibroid in the uterine fundus.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
Interventional Radiology was consulted for thoracentesis and 500 ml of serosanguinous fluid consisting of blood elements was drained. There was suspicion of thoracic endometriosis due to the temporal relationship between commencement of symptoms and menstrual cycle each month. The patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery (VATS) that identified implants on the diaphragm and abnormal lung with remnants of hemorrhage in the pleura. The specimens were studied histologically, and diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis was confirmed.

Patient was started on Leuprolide; however, after a few months, she stopped the treatment, as she was not able to tolerate it. She did have a relapse of her symptoms and again presented to emergency department where she was managed conservatively.

Follow-up:
Patient was discharged in a stable condition and has been advised to follow up with her gynecologist for management of her uterine fibroids and thoracic endometriosis. She has been provided with information regarding alternative treatment options, and a cessation of smoking has been strongly urged.

Hospital Course:
The patient is a 78-year-old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type II diabetes mellitus, who presented with recurrent bouts of abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. He reported a dull aching pain that had waxed and waned over the last decade and described intermittent sharp pain in the right upper quadrant associated with fluctuating low-grade fevers and anorexia. The patient underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy in 2003, which resulted in recurrent bouts of abdominal pain and was subsequently diagnosed with gallstone spillage in 2005. The patient opted for conservative treatment with acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In 2016, a CT scan revealed a necrotic phlegmon, which was subjected to aspiration, leading to considerable relief of symptoms and sustained amelioration provided by a gabapentin prescription.
Upon admission, the patient presented with a fever of 104°F, tachycardia, and a tender abdomen with marked sensitivity in the right upper quadrant. A whole body CT scan showed a large retrohepatic abscess, which was drained percutaneously and sent for gram stain, culture, and bilirubin assay. The gram stain showed branching gram-positive rods concerning for Actinomyces, Nocardia, and Streptomyces, while the culture growth was positive for Propionibacterium, leading to a regimen of IV vancomycin, piperacillin-tazobactam, TMP-SMX, and ampicillin-sulbactam. The patient was shifted to the ICU due to persistent fever and tachycardia, where he developed a pleural effusion and chest tube placement was utilized, with two doses of lytic therapy with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) via the catheter. Repeat CT scans were performed, showing the reduction of the abscess and pleural effusion. Following discharge, the patient underwent a procedure for upsizing the drain, which allowed for endoscopy of the abscess cavity, leading to the removal of two gallstones and replacement of the drain, with the patient being followed up as an outpatient.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to our hospital with a 4-month history of episodic, painful, horizontal binocular diplopia. She denied any oscillopsia. She was previously treated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with several courses of chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy. General neurological examination findings were unremarkable. Neuro-ophthalmic examination revealed normal visual acuity, visual fields, pupils, and fundi. Ocular alignment showed orthotropia and orthophoria by alternate cover test.

However, following a 30-s right eccentric gaze, the patient developed involuntary contraction of the left medial rectus, which resulted in left esotropia while returning both eyes to the primary position. The left esotropia lasted approximately 2 min, then spontaneously resolved. Likewise, these spells occurred following a 30-s gaze in the opposite direction, which resulted in right esotropia in the primary position. Both the pupils and the eyelid positions remained normal throughout the examination. Prolonged vertical eccentric gaze did not induce any ocular misalignment.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Age: 61
Gender: Male

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital due to hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor of approximately 5 cm diameter at the liver segment IV. The patient underwent partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage. During the postoperative day 1, bile drainage was observed from the drain placed in the foramen of Winslow. Fluid collection between the liver and fistula was found through a CT scan. The patient was put under simple drainage to reduce the cavity.

On postoperative day 19, the patient experienced fever and a CT scan revealed an increase in fluid collection. Percutaneous drainage was performed to the cavity near the liver cut surface. The patient was diagnosed with bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII. Functional remnant liver volume was calculated, which was found to be sufficient for bile leakage management.

The therapeutic strategy involved a combination of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography drainage (PTCD) tube insertion, percutaneous transhepatic portal embolization (PTPE), and bile duct ablation. PTPE with coil embolization was performed to the part of the portal vein of segments V and VIII by puncturing the part of the portal vein of segment V. Bile leakage decreased to about 50 mL/day. An injection of 1.2 mL pure ethanol was made, which leaked into the abdominal cavity. The PTCD tubes were clamped for 5 min. Another bile duct ablation with 2.0 mL of pure ethanol was performed 1 week after the first procedure. Bile leakage decreased from 50 to 10 mL/day gradually. The patient was reinjected with 2.0 mL of pure ethanol for three times.

The patient was discharged after 139 postoperative days. The drainage tube and bile duct tube were removed. The clinical course was uneventful, and no complications were noted during the combination treatment of PTPE and bile duct ablation.

Diagnosis:

The patient had hepatocellular carcinoma with a tumor of approximately 5 cm diameter at the liver segment IV. The patient had a history of excessive alcohol consumption. Partial hepatectomy with segments IV + V and cholecystectomy with cystic duct-tube drainage were performed. During the postoperative day 1, bile leakage was observed. The patient was diagnosed with bile leakage from the isolated bile duct of segments V and VIII.

Admitted: June 2014
Discharged: May 2015
Length of Stay: 11 months

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 57-year-old male, was admitted in June 2014 due to increasing abdominal pain. A colonoscopy was performed which revealed a stenotic and ulcerated lesion in the sigmoid region. Computed tomography (CT) revealed hepatic nodules, a hypodense nodular formation in the right adrenal gland, and a focal wall thickening in the descending colon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination showed pulmonary micronodules, suggestive of secondary implants. The patient underwent a laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with primary colorectal anastomosis, followed by palliative chemotherapy. The patient received FOLFOX (10 cycles) as a first-line treatment and FOLFIRI (3 cycles) as second-line regimen. CT imaging was conducted every 2-3 months to evaluate the hepatic lesions, and the serum marker carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was evaluated. Microscopic evaluation of the surgical specimen revealed a moderately differentiated sigmoid adenocarcinoma with mucinous pattern areas. The pathology stage was pT4apN2apM1, and lymph-node metastases were detected in four of fourteen lymph-nodes dissected from adjacent adipose.

Summary of Findings:

During the hospital course, the patient's hepatic nodules increased in size and number. Samples from the primary tumor, metastasis, and plasma were sequenced, and an activating KRAS mutation was identified by routine molecular testing for metastatic colorectal cancer. Targeted resequencing was performed in the Ion Proton platform with the Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer Hotspot Panel v2, and tumor-specific genomic DNA mutations were assessed. The allele frequency of two aforementioned tumor-specific mutations in KRAS and TP53 decreased significantly and became undetectable by NGS in PS3. CTDNA analysis showed that the patient's mutation frequencies started to rise after 3 cycles of FOLFOX treatment.

48,"Hospital Course Summary:

Patient has been admitted to the hospital for Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) which was suspected during his inpatient stay after presenting with urinary retention issues and facial weakness and numbness. AIDP was diagnosed via EDX studies and the patient was treated with a five-day course of IVIG. On completion of his IVIG treatment, the patient was transferred to inpatient rehabilitation with significant proximal lower extremity weakness and bilateral upper extremities slight weakness. The patient had also lost significant strength in his bilateral lower extremities where dorsiflexion was graded at 1/5 and plantar flexion was graded at 3/5. Sensation to light touch had also diminished in all dermatomes of bilateral upper extremities. 

Upon evaluation in inpatient rehabilitation, patient required significant help to perform toileting hygiene, showering, upper body dressing, lower body dressing, footwear management, rolling left and right, and all transfers. The patient was unable to ambulate and was dependent on a wheelchair. During his four weeks of inpatient therapy, the patient improved significantly, achieving independence in supine-to-sit, upper and lower body dressing, and rolling right and left in bed. The patient was able to stand with the support of his spouse and primarily relied on bilateral upper extremity support via a walker for stability and offloading his lower extremities. At discharge, the patient was given a power wheelchair for mobility as he was unable to transfer in and out of a car, thus requiring a wheelchair van for transportation. The patient's blood pressure remained stable throughout his stay with a reading of 121/65 mmHg upon discharge.",,,0
873,"Discharge Summary

Patient: 49-year-old male

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to the hospital with spontaneous bruising and mucosal bleeding. He had a platelet count of 2 × 10^9/L, which improved with the administration of prednisone. Despite laparoscopic splenectomy and various treatments, the patient experienced cyclic thrombocytopenia for over 10 years, with platelet counts fluctuating with a statistically significant period of 39 days.

Hospital Course:
The patient received treatment with corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, danazol, pulse dexamethasone, and rituximab, but none were effective in resolving the persistent thrombocytopenia. Serial measurements of thrombopoietin (TPO) levels were taken, which revealed undetectable levels during periods of extreme thrombocytosis and increased levels when platelet counts were low.

Treatment:
Treatment with the TPO receptor agonist eltrombopag was started and timed with anticipated periods of thrombocytopenia. The patient received 50 mg of eltrombopag daily during specific periods, resulting in extreme thrombocytosis that did not alter the cycle pattern or period. Therefore, eltrombopag was discontinued thereafter.

Summary:
The patient presented with thrombocytopenia, which improved with prednisone and laparoscopic splenectomy. However, the thrombocytopenia relapsed and persisted for over 10 years. Serial measurements of TPO levels were taken, and treatment with eltrombopag was started and then discontinued due to its ineffectiveness in resolving the cyclic thrombocytopenia.",,,0

Patient Name: Cavalier King Charles Spaniel (10 years, female, neutered)

Hospital Dates: [Admission Date] - [Discharge Date]

Reason for Hospitalization:
The patient presented with a gradually enlarging mass on the right frontal bone. CT imaging revealed a neoplastic process, and surgery was performed for mass excision.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent craniotomy with resection margins guided by a customized template. Following tumour resection, a pre-contoured Ti mesh was firmly seated to the patient's skull, covering the defect. Prophylactic intravenous antibiotic cover was given before surgery and every 90 minutes thereafter. Post-operative analgesia was provided, and the dog was discharged six days after surgery.

Follow-up:
Two weeks post-discharge, the patient returned for suture removal. The surgical wound had healed, and physical examination was within normal limits. At the ten weeks recheck, physical examination was unremarkable, and the owner reported no restrictions on the patient's activities. The patient presented a small bone-like mass near the resection site at 7-months assessment. A CT scan identified the region of proliferation as dorsal and to the right side of the Ti mesh. Further examination of the mass was declined by the owner.

Recommendations:
A histological diagnosis of multilobular osteochondrosarcoma was made, with potential for local recurrence advised. Long-term follow-up is recommended, and the owner should continue to monitor for any changes in the patient's behaviour or physical examination.",,,0

Length of Stay: [REDACTED]
Admitting Diagnosis: High-grade brainstem tumor

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 34-year-old Caucasian female, was admitted to the hospital with complaints of right hemiparesis, numbness, dysphagia, and ataxia. These symptoms began as numbness over her right scapular area two weeks prior, and the numbness later progressed to include the right leg. Additionally, she reported five days of waking up during the night with severe headaches, which were different in nature from her previous migraines. After workup in the emergency department and neurology consultation, the patient was referred to neurosurgery for management of a high-grade brainstem tumor.
On initial presentation, the patient's pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light, and her cranial nerves were grossly intact. Motor testing revealed that strength was 5/5 in both upper and lower extremities, and dysmetria was noted in the right upper extremity during finger-to-nose testing. The patient experienced a progressive decline during her initial admission, to include mild left facial droop, dysarthria, and worsening dysphagia. These symptoms continued until her initial discharge. Upon readmission, the patient displayed similar findings, including left lower quadrant abdominal pain radiating to the shoulder and acute numbness of the left chest and shoulder. These symptoms progressed and worsened until the patient was intubated after deteriorating to a GCS score of 10.
The patient underwent a closed stereotactic needle biopsy, during which biopsy samples were successfully obtained for pathologic examination. Postoperatively, a nasogastric tube was placed to provide nutrition, due to worsening dysphagia. On Day 10 of her hospitalization, a PEG tube was placed. The patient was scheduled for chemotherapy and craniospinal radiation therapy, and was discharged on Day 12. Four days later, the patient returned due to worsening symptoms, and dexamethasone was increased. The patient was started on temozolomide IV, but she developed respiratory acidosis/hypercapnia with a CO2 of 115 and was started on a BIPAP, two days later. As a result, a rapid response team was called to transfer the patient to the ICU. The temozolomide was converted to oral dosing via a PEG tube. The patient's family was consulted regarding the patient's status and their options. The patient chose to update her status to do not intubate. The patient was extubated prior to her discharge to a hospice care facility, where she passed away four days later.

Imaging:
MRI of the brain with and without contrast revealed a heterogeneous T1 hypointense and T2 hyperintense signal abnormality involving the pontine base and extending into the medulla. There was mildly increased relative cerebral blood flow and blood volume within the enhancing portion of the abnormality, suggesting neovascularity. The pontine component of the lesion also showed no abnormal enhancement or significant hyperperfusion. Mild mass effect on the fourth ventricle was noted. There was no peritumoral edema or significant mass effect. A CT scan of the chest with and without contrast enhancement revealed scattered small ground glass and nodular opacities bilaterally.

Pathology:
The brain biopsy was originally interpreted as a classic medulloblastoma (WHO Grade 4). However, the diagnosis was amended at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital to small cell glioblastoma (WHO Grade 4). Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (iFISH) analysis revealed platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA) amplification. No amplification of MYC, NMYC, or epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was observed.

Follow-up:
The patient passed away at a hospice care facility four days after discharge.",,,0
564,"Hospital Course Summary: 

Patient is a 41-year-old female who was admitted with symptoms of persistent liver dysfunction, painless xanthochromia and skin itching for 3 months. Physical examination revealed severe icteric sclera and skin without any abdominal tenderness. 

Diagnostic Results: 

Liver function tests showed severe hepatic injury and obstructive jaundice. Ultrasound of the liver showed a cystic mass with sharp margins in the left medial liver lobe and obstruction of the biliary tract. CT and MRI confirmed the presence of a cystic mass with homogeneous water-density lesions, indicating a hepatic cyst. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed a lump in the common bile duct but no stones were found. A subsequent open procedure confirmed a large pedunculated lump from the liver, which resembled the gallbladder with a capsule wall and capsular space. Histopathologic examination confirmed the lump was a hepatic cyst wall without heterocysts or tumor cells. 

Hospital Course: 

Endoscopic retrograde biliary drainage (ERBD) and endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) were performed to drain bile in order to manage severe hepatic injury and jaundice, instead of laparotomy due to coagulation disorders. After these procedures, there was a gradual decrease in icteric sclera and skin, recovery of liver function, and normalization of coagulation disorders. Four weeks later, open operation was performed, and the pedunculated lump from the liver was removed entirely from the lump's root through endoscopic needle-knife electrotomy without active hemorrhage. 

Treatment: 

A T-tube was retained in the common bile duct to prevent bile leakage and observe the recovery of the root incision of the lump and postoperative bleeding. The patient was discharged with appropriate post-operative care instructions. 

Follow-up: 

Epigastric ultrasound and CT two months later showed a normal hepatic duct and unchanged hepatic cyst size. Choledochoscopic examination was performed through a T-tube fistula. The cyst had remained unchanged, and there was no evidence of bile duct tumor. Three years after the procedure, the patient was in good health, without signs of cholestasis or bile duct stones. The cyst had barely changed in size. 

Summary: 

This hospital course summary is for a 41-year-old female who presented with persistent liver dysfunction and painless xanthochromia and skin itching for 3 months. She was diagnosed with a hepatic cyst and managed with endoscopic procedures and open surgery to remove a pedunculated lump from the liver, which resembled the gallbladder with a capsule wall and capsular space. The patient was discharged with post-operative care instructions and continued to follow up in the subsequent years.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: CNS Vasculitis

Reason for Hospital Admission:

The patient was transferred to the primary facility for further evaluation for possible CNS vasculitis. She was admitted to the outside facility for a total of four weeks and the primary facility for a subsequent 23-day period.

Hospital Course:

Upon admission, the patient presented with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus type two, obesity, and hemorrhagic stroke. During her stay at the outside facility, she experienced lethargy, fluctuating cognition, and difficulty speaking, prompting the initiation of aggressive antihypertensive therapy and a series of diagnostic tests. A baseline CT scan of the head without contrast showed multiple lacunar infarcts while an MRI and MRA revealed bilateral punctate infarcts of the left thalamus, right periventricular white matter, and right centrum semiovale, and high-grade stenosis affecting the MCAs and the PICA. A spinal tap demonstrated elevated protein, IgG synthesis rate, and myelin basic protein, which were concerning for CNS vasculitis.

Upon transfer to the primary facility, the patient remained hemodynamically stable, and her cardiovascular risk factors were closely monitored. A leptomeningeal biopsy and IV corticosteroids were recommended by the specialist for confirmation of CNS vasculitis, although the biopsy was not performed due to the patient's significant neurological deficits and high surgical risks.

A four-vessel angiogram showed 50% stenosis in the petrous and cavernous segments of the left internal carotid artery, a completely occluded M1 segment of the left MCA, and multiple alternating foci of narrowing within the M2 and M3 branches of the right MCA, as well as the P2 and P3 branches of the PCA.

Medical History:
- Constant pain in the right proximal thigh for 8 years
- Menarche at age 13
- No family history of sclerosing bone diseases
- Polycystic ovaries with normal androgen status
- Leg length discrepancy
- Previous consultation with a rheumatologist for hip joint pain
- Mild traffic accident six months prior to referral

Summary of Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with constant pain in the right proximal thigh that had persisted for 8 years, which had been moderately relieved during physical activity and by cold baths. Mild pain relief was achieved with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, paracetamol and weak opioid agonists. The patient had a gynecological examination that revealed a mild degree of polycystic ovaries with normal androgen status. An X-ray showed significant cortical thickening in the right femoral diaphysis that partially obliterated the medullary cavity. MR and PET-CT scans revealed uneven surface of the sclerotic bone. A bone biopsy was performed and showed thickened bone springs with preserved lamellar structure and slightly accentuated cement lines. After ruling out several other diagnoses, melorheostosis was diagnosed as the most plausible diagnosis. The first line of treatment with zoledronic acid 5mg was given, with the second and third injections being less effective than the first. Denosumab was then chosen as the second line of treatment to control a hypermetabolic state. Pain relief was achieved after the first injection; however, there was a slight increase in pain after 6 weeks. Therefore, the interval between injections was shortened and remained constant up to the latest follow-up in February 2018. There were no adverse effects reported during the entire treatment period. After the first three doses given 8 weeks apart, there was pain remission for 8 months, where the patient did not take any orally administered analgesics. At the latest follow-up, the patient complained of a slight increase in pain, which was occasionally treated with paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. A Tc99-bone scan and CT scan were performed in February 2017 and in February 2018, respectively, and the pathologically increased activity and cortical thickening were stationary.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our Oncological Unit to begin adjuvant chemotherapy for his stage IIIA poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which was detected after undergoing a McKeown minimally invasive esophagectomy for middle third esophageal cancer. During the patient's admission, a CT scan and positron emission tomography revealed multiple recurrences to right paratracheal lymph node, anterior chest wall, and right adrenal gland.

However, a few days after admission, the patient experienced acute onset of severe upper abdominal pain, nausea, and dyspnea, which developed after a prolonged effort at defecation. On clinical examination, the patient was found to be pale, bradycardic, hypotensive, and tachypneic. Further testing revealed near-complete herniation of the small bowel, transverse colon, and greater omentum through a large defect of the left hemidiaphragm, resulting in ipsilateral massive lung collapse.

The patient was immediately transferred to our surgical unit to undergo emergency relaparoscopy for a giant diaphragmatic hernia, which was successfully repaired. The patient's hernia orifice was primarily closed by approximating its anterior and posterior borders through a series of interrupted nonabsorbable stitches. A neo-hiatus was created, paying attention not to overtight the gastric conduit and preserve its vascular supply.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged from the hospital after 7 days. No signs of hernia recurrence were identified on CT scan at 3-month follow-up. Unfortunately, the patient passed away 2 months later due to neoplastic cachexia.

The 56-year-old Japanese male patient was referred to the hospital due to dyspnea, hypotension, and left-sided chest pain. He had a history of Parkinson's disease with psychosis. Upon examination, he exhibited poor dentition and inadequate hygiene. Laboratory tests showed elevated white blood cell count with a left shift, low hemoglobin, and elevated CRP. Chest radiography revealed a mass in the left upper lung, bilateral pleural effusions, and cardiac enlargement. Chest CT scan showed a wedge-shaped and pleural-based mass in the left upper lobe, a thick-walled cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe, bilateral pleural effusions, and pericardial effusion. The patient underwent pericardiocentesis and pericardial drainage and was diagnosed with bacterial pericarditis and lung abscess in the left lower lobe. Empirical antibiotic treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone was started.

On day 6, the patient was stable, and the pericardial drainage tube, which showed minimal fluid, was removed. On day 9, the patient experienced a fever of 39.0 °C (102.2 °F), and sinus tachycardia occurred, with atrial fibrillation and cardiac arrest with asystole. The patient underwent an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which restored sinus rhythm and blood pressure. Chest CT scan obtained on the same day showed the remaining thick-walled cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe and the reduced pericardial effusion. Ultrasound-guided pneumocentesis of the cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe was performed, which revealed Actinomyces species growth.

Diagnostic Assessment:
Transbronchial biopsy and bronchial washing of the mass lesion in both the left upper and lower lobes were performed, revealing non-specific inflammation and organization of the lung tissue with no bacteria present. Blood cultures did not show any organisms.

Chest and abdominal CT scans showed no evidence of new liver lesions or metastasis to the lung, except for lymph node metastases in the lesser curvature area of the stomach. Surgical resection was performed, which involved esophageal resection via right thoracotomy with regional lymph node dissection. Esophagogastrostomy was performed, and the whole stomach was used for reconstruction to provide better protection of the submucosal vessels.

Postoperative course was complicated by detection of multinodular-type HCC in both lobes of the liver two months following the operation. The patient received no additional therapies and succumbed to disease progression two months following the operation.

Summary of Findings:

- A 71-year-old Japanese man with a history of HCC underwent a left lateral segmentectomy for HCC
- Serum AFP level increased two years post-surgery; Follow-up examination detected a metastatic esophageal tumor from HCC
- Surgical resection was performed via right thoracotomy with regional lymph node dissection and esophagogastrostomy
- Multinodular-type HCC was detected in both lobes of the liver two months post-operation
- Patient died from disease progression two months follow the operation.",,,0

Hospital Course:

An 18 year-old female patient reported to our dental outpatient unit with a fractured and discolored tooth in the maxillary anterior region three years before. The patient gave a history of trauma five years back with occasional pus discharge from the gingiva in relation to maxillary right and left central incisor tooth #11 and tooth #21. Medical history was noncontributory. Clinical examination revealed an enamel fracture in relation to tooth #11 and a discolored tooth with enamel–dentin–pulp fracture in relation to tooth #21.

A regenerative procedure was planned for tooth #11 using processed freeze-dried irradiated human amniotic membrane as a scaffold with biodentine as a restorative material. The patient was asymptomatic during the treatment and at 15 days, 3 months, 19 months and 36 months follow-up. The intra oral radiographic examination revealed healing of periapical lesion, thickening of dentinal walls as well as a mineralized dentin bridge formation over Biodentine™.

The patient was explained about the extensive use of HAM in clinical scenarios and its use in a root canal is off-label. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient after a thorough explanation of the treatment procedure. The patient was lost to follow up and returned to the clinic at 19 months.

Based on the above information, the patient was treated successfully without complications. The patient remained asymptomatic throughout the treatment and follow-up visits. No further treatment is required at this time.

Discharge Instructions:

The patient should maintain good oral hygiene through regular brushing and flossing. The patient should avoid biting or chewing hard objects with the treated tooth and should schedule regular dental check-ups to monitor the healing progress. In case of any discomfort or swelling, the patient should contact the hospital immediately.

The patient is a 45-year-old male who presented with a painless right parotid swelling that was progressively increasing in size, which was accompanied by occasional jaw lock. The patient had no significant family medical history or prior history of radiation. Physical examination revealed a tender swelling below the ear lobule, which was firm, diffused, nodular, and fixed to the underlying muscles.

Imaging and Diagnosis:
The patient underwent a neck CT scan and MRI of the parotid glands, which revealed a well-defined altered signal enhancing mass measuring 3.5 × 2.2 × 2.0 cm at the posterior aspect of the superficial part of the right parotid gland, likely to be a benign pleomorphic adenoma. However, a fine-needle aspiration cytology of the mass was non-conclusive. The patient underwent a superficial parotidectomy, which was performed in piecemeal as the mass was unexpectedly adherent to the skin and underlying fascia. Histopathologic examination revealed a widely infiltrative tumor involving the parotid parenchyma and extending into the surrounding adipose tissue and skeletal muscles, which was diagnosed as a low-grade MPNST arising in a diffuse neurofibroma.

Management and Follow-Up:
The patient was evaluated clinically for features of NF1, and multiple café au lait macules were subsequently discovered on his trunk. The patient was referred to a cancer center for further management and follow-up. Further clinical examination and MRI revealed no distant metastasis.

The patient, a 19-year-old man, was admitted with complaints of polydipsia, polyuria, muscle weakness, vomiting, and paralysis. He was hospitalized with severe hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis due to renal tubular acidosis and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI). The patient was diagnosed with precursor B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) with acquired NDI. Leukemic infiltration of the kidneys may have led to polydipsia and polyuria. The patient showed an excellent response to standardized combination chemotherapy and achieved complete remission (CR) at the end of induction. 

The patient refused the best therapy of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) but received haplo-SCT from his father after relapse. A graft-versus-leukemia effect was induced with the intervention of donor lymphocyte infusion, which achieved sustained remission. However, the patient reported a fungal pulmonary infection and was found to have bilateral renal enlargement with low density.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to the ophthalmology clinic with a persisting vertical diplopia on left and superior gaze for 8 months. Examination revealed a restriction of superior gaze of the left eye. He was referred to the otolaryngology clinic for further evaluation. A CT scan revealed a 5 mm defect in the posterior medial orbital floor with inferior displacement of the inferior rectus muscle into the defect.

The patient underwent revision endoscopic sinus surgery to revise the maxillary antrostomy and transconjunctival orbitotomy to release the inferior rectus muscle and repair the orbital floor defect. A forced duction test was free of restriction, and a smooth porous polyethylene implant was used to repair the orbital floor defect. Postoperatively, surveillance via rigid nasal endoscopy in the office showed that the left maxillary antrostomy did not develop scarring or restenosis.

The patient was admitted with complaints of increased serum creatinine levels and no other symptoms. The physical examination did not show any particular findings. Laboratory tests revealed renal dysfunction with elevated C-reactive protein. Urinary markers for tubular injury were also high. Renal biopsy was performed, which showed marked interstitial lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltration indicative of AIN. 

The patient's medication history revealed he had been diagnosed with temporal lobe epilepsy 12 years ago and was using carbamazepine, zonisamide, valproate, and lacosamide. After discontinuing zonisamide and starting oral prednisolone, the patient's serum creatinine levels decreased, and prednisolone dose was tapered monthly. However, serum creatinine levels increased again 10 months later, and 67Ga scintigraphy showed AIN recurrence. 

Valproate and lacosamide were discontinued, and oral prednisolone was restarted. Renal function immediately improved, although minor epilepsy occurrence increased. Prednisolone dose was gradually tapered; however, serum creatinine levels rose again after reaching 1.99 mg/dL. Repeat renal biopsy revealed similar findings as tubulitis with both lymphocytic and eosinophilic infiltrations. 

A dose of 1500 mg of oral mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was added to the corticosteroid therapy since the patient had multiple AIN recurrence, and was corticosteroid dependent, which was well tolerated. This allowed for successful prednisolone dose tapering to 5 mg daily, serum creatinine level stabilization, and no AIN recurrence for over 20 months.

Discharge Medications:
- Prednisolone 5 mg daily
- Carbamazepine

Follow-Up:
The patient should see the neurologist regularly for epilepsy treatment and continue following up with the nephrology department for AIN recurrence monitoring.

This is a discharge summary for a 4-year-old female patient who underwent surgery under general anesthesia for the treatment of concomitant exotropia. Ten days following the surgery, she developed a subconjunctival cyst in her left eye, which was discovered to be caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. She underwent a surgical exploration that revealed thin purulent fluid in the subconjunctival cyst made up of necrotic soft tissue. The broken end of medial rectus was found to be firmly attached to the sclera surface. A pathological test was performed with the extracted necrotic tissue, which revealed left subconjunctival chronic suppurative inflammation. 

Treatment:
The patient was treated with an antibiotic sensitivity test and was found to respond well to vancomycin administered via intravenous drip, and local antibiotic and corticosteroid eye drops. The conjunctival suture was removed five days postoperatively due to the presence of scant mucous discharge. The patient was then seen again for her first postoperative follow-up after one month from the surgery, and complete recovery of conjunctival incision was observed with right binocular alignment. 

Clinical Picture:
The patient underwent surgical intervention and developed a subconjunctival cyst 10 days afterward which was caused by MRSA infection. Surgical exploration revealed the presence of thin purulent fluid in the subconjunctival cyst mostly made up of necrotic soft tissue. She responded well to a course of treatment which included vancomycin administered via intravenous drip, and local antibiotic and corticosteroid eye drops. 

Follow-up:
The patient recovered completely following the treatment, and the first postoperative follow-up 1 month after the surgery showed complete recovery of the conjunctival incision with right binocular alignment.",,,0

Diagnosis: Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC)

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of fatigue and chest tightness for 7 days. Physical examination revealed typical facial angiofibromas and multiple periungual fibromas, as well as abdominal distention. Lab results indicated moderate anemia and renal insufficiency. The patient also had giant bilateral renal angiomyolipomas (AML) and lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) in both lungs. Hereditary history indicated that the patient's son died of epilepsy at the age of six, and her daughter had the presentation of typical facial angiofibromas and multiple periungual fibromas. After a thorough examination, the patient was diagnosed with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC).

Treatment:
Due to the severity of her condition, the patient was started on the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (10mg/d) to treat her giant bilateral renal AMLs. After two months of treatment, the patient experienced a significant alleviation in the feeling of abdominal swelling. However, she was unable to continue the treatment due to financial difficulties.

Follow-up:
After six months of follow-up, the patient remained stable. Her husband and granddaughter did not show any significant symptoms or abnormalities on testing.

Mutation Analysis:
The patient was found to carry a c.3610G > A substitution in the TSC2 gene, resulting in a p.Gly1204Arg substitution at amino acid position 1204. The patient's daughter also carried the same substitution. The mutation was considered to be novel, highly conserved among different species, and predicted as deleterious by three different softwares.  In silico analysis showed that the c.3610G > A mutation could alter the splicing of the TSC2 transcript.

Prognosis:
Based on the patient's condition and follow-up results, the patient's prognosis fell within the normal range of patients with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.

Recommendations:
The patient is advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, avoid stress, and attend regular follow-ups with an appropriate medical professional.

Gender: Female
Admission Date: [Date]
Discharge Date: [Date]
Diagnosis: Pigmented Villonodular Synovitis (PVNS)

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 49-year-old previously healthy female, was admitted with a 1-week history of posterior-region knee pain that occurred after falling directly onto her left knee from a standing position. Following the fall, she experienced blocked knee joint and limited range of motion of 30 to 60 degrees of flexion. On examination, the patient had good lower-limb alignment and no pain was provoked on meniscal and ligament testing. She also had an absence of muscular atrophy.

Upon examination, the patient's range of motion was limited to only 30 to 60 degrees of flexion with pain on active range of motion. She had pain upon active and passive extension of the knee joint with tingling and numbness over the calf region extending from the knee posteriorly. MRI revealed a multiloculated structure arising from the synovium around the cruciate ligaments within the femoral notch extending beyond the joint capsule posteriorly with moderate anterior joint effusion.

The patient underwent arthroscopic intervention in the left knee under spinal anesthesia. The posterior compartment of the knee was reached arthroscopically through the triangular space formed by the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) laterally, posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) medially, and the femoral notch superiorly. Total resection of the lesion was done through only anterior knee portals without taking the risk of posterior portals preventing potential neurovascular injury. The pathology report confirmed the presence of PVNS.

On 6-month MRI follow-up, the previously described soft tissue enhancement suggestive of residual inflammatory changes noted within the femoral notch along the cruciate ligaments as well as posterior to the distal metaphysis at the site of the previously present lesion has decreased. The synovial fluid had also decreased with no evidence of hemosiderin deposits. There was no evidence of interval appearance of new susceptibility artifacts or blooming effect on the T2 gradient sequence that could correspond to evident recurrence. The compressive effect previously present on the popliteal vessels has completely disappeared with no further tingling sensation and numbness over the calf region. Clinically, the patient regained full range of motion on flexion extension (0° to 135°) of the knee. The previously reported pain no longer exists, with no blocking upon flexion. The patient underwent physical therapy protocol and showed significant muscle strength and balancing improvement. She was scheduled to 1-year clinical follow-up.

Discharge Condition:
The patient's discharge condition is stable and satisfactory. The patient is to follow-up on 1-year clinical check-ups for further evaluation.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted to the clinic for debonded restoration in tooth #22.

Medical History:
The patient had no significant medical history.

Hospital Course:
Rehabilitation with PCRV (Componeer - Brilliant NG) was proposed to address the debonded restoration in tooth #22. Color matching was performed using the A2/B2 dentin shade associated with the veneer (transparent). Moisture was controlled with a rubber dam during the restoration procedure.

A minimal preparation was performed on the tooth buccal surface using a diamond bur #2068 to facilitate the setting of the PCRV. The dental substrate was etched with 37% phosphoric acid (Magic Acid, Coltene) for 30 seconds, followed by abundant water rinse and air drying. The adhesive system One Coat Bond (Coltene) was applied with a Technobrush (Coltene) both on the tooth and on the internal surface of PCRV. The Brilliant NG composite resin (A2/B2 dentin) was used as the luting agent.

The veneer was fixed on the tooth using the instrument “Placer” included in the Componeer system. Excess resin was removed after a slight compression of the PCRV. The light-curing was carried out with an LED (Radii cal, SDI, Bayswater, Victoria, Australia) with an irradiance of 1.200 mW/cm2 for 40 seconds. No final polishing was required due to pre-polishing of the PCRV by the manufacturers.

The patient's problem was successfully addressed, and the patient was extremely pleased with the results.

Discharge Diagnosis: Lung metastasis resembling low-grade right ureteral orifice bladder tumor

Hospital Course: 

Patient presented to the hospital with signs and symptoms of lung metastasis that resembled the low-grade right ureteral orifice bladder tumor. The patient had a 40 pack-year smoking history and had previously undergone transurethral resection of the bladder tumor and ureteroscopic resection of the right ureter. The patient also underwent hand-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy for upper urinary tract tumor removal. Following the surgery, the patient underwent six rounds of bacillus Calmette-Guérin treatment in an adjuvant setting, followed by maintenance treatment for three years.

After careful examination, the patient's mutations present in the tumors were analyzed to identify genetic changes that could point towards a therapeutic target for any future recurrence or metastasis. Variants shared by the primary bladder tumor and the lung metastasis include mutations in the KMT2D and RXRA genes. Mutations unique to the lung metastasis included a clinically actionable, activating mutation in mTOR (C1483F). 

A mutational signature for the patient was developed, which resembled published mutational Signature 1A/B and Signature 5. Using the Drug Gene Interaction Database, candidate drugs targeting 12 of the 100 genes with SNVs in the lung tumor were identified, including the RXRA agonist bexarotene and mTOR inhibitors like everolimus. 

Primary culture of the lung metastasis was established in the laboratory, and the cells were treated with mTOR inhibitor everolimus at two concentrations (10 and 50 nM). The treatment showed a marked inhibition of mTOR activity and downstream signaling via two of its effectors, p70 S6K and 4E-BP1, at both concentrations. AKT activity increased with everolimus treatment, possibly indicating a mechanism of resistance to the mTOR inhibitor. 

On discharge, the patient was advised to follow up with their oncologist regarding further treatment options and therapy. Further genetic testing was recommended, along with regular lung function and cancer screenings due to the patient's history of tobacco smoking. The patient was discharged in stable condition and was advised to attend all follow-up appointments as scheduled.",,,0

The [Age] [Gender] patient was admitted to our hospital for itching around her anus. Physical examination showed an erythematous, inflamed skin lesion in the perianal region. The patient had a history of sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis and Sjögren's syndrome. However, no gastrointestinal symptoms, change in bowel habits, weight loss, or family history of malignancy was reported.

Investigations: 
Colposcopy, cystoscopy, nor colonoscopy revealed any abnormality of the cervix, bladder, or rectum. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed no evidence of malignancy in the genitourinary or gastrointestinal tracts. Histopathological examination of biopsy specimens showed many Paget’s cells within intraepithelial lesions of the perianal skin but no malignant cells in the rectal or vaginal mucosa. 

Diagnosis: 
Primary extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD) of the anogenital region was suspected. 

Treatment: 
Anal-preserving wide local excision deep to the subcutaneous fat with 1-cm negative margin from the positive sites confirmed by frozen section examination and mucosal resection of the anal canal that extended 1 cm proximal to the dentate line of the anal canal. Reconstruction was performed using a bilobed gluteal fold flap. 

Histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed Paget’s cells within the epidermis. Immunohistochemical markers revealed that the Paget’s cells were positive for cytokeratin 7, cytokeratin 20, and caudal-related homeobox gene nuclear transcription factor 2 and negative for gross cystic disease fluid protein 15. Additional histopathological examination of the resected specimen showed well-differentiated adenocarcinoma in an anal gland, continuous with the Paget’s cells in the anoderm but limited in the basement membrane without a desmoplastic change. Immunohistochemical staining of the resected specimen revealed secondary EMPD due to adenocarcinoma arising from the anal gland.

Due to the possibility of residual adenocarcinoma in the anal gland, possibly extending to the sphincter, a radical laparoscopy-assisted abdominoperineal resection was performed. No reconstructive plastic surgery was needed.

Admitting Diagnosis: Infertility
Primary Diagnosis at Discharge: Xanthogranulomatous salpingo ophritis

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 21-year-old female, presented to our outpatient department with complaints of infertility for the past 5 years. She reported irregular menstrual bleeding and dysmenorrhea for the past 5 months. On examination, a lump in the abdomen measuring 8 X 8 cm was found in the left iliac fossa, and her per vaginum and per speculum examinations revealed bilateral tender fornices and a bulky uterus. Further evaluation revealed the presence of a left ovarian cyst (5 X 4 cm) with septations, a bulky uterus with multiple fibroids on the anterior and posterior walls, bilateral blocked fallopian tubes, and right-sided tortuous and edematous fallopian tubes. A laparotomy procedure was performed, resulting in a left salpingo oophorectomy due to the presence of a large tubo-ovarian mass measuring 6 X 7 cm and a 5 X 2 cm fibroid in the anterior wall of the uterus. Histopathological examination of the specimen revealed a diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous salpingo ophritis. No growth, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, was found upon culture and sensitivity analysis of the pus drained from the omentum. Other investigations revealed elevated CA 125 levels (246 U/ml) and normal thyroid levels.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient presented with infertility, which was later attributed to xanthogranulomatous salpingo ophritis.

Admission date: [Date]

Discharge date: [Date]

Reason for admission:

The patient, a 78-year-old woman, was admitted to the Department of Neurology after experiencing her third episode of generalized tonic clonic seizures. The patient had previously been diagnosed with a glioma and had received a resection 5 years prior.

Medical History:

The patient had been taking warfarin for 14 years as a secondary prevention measure against embolic events resulting from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF). Apart from a diagnosis of glioma and warfarin use, the patient’s medical history was unremarkable.

Hospitalization course:

Upon admission, the patient was treated for status epilepticus (SE) with intravenous diazepam to terminate a five-minute episode of GTCS, followed by a loading dose of intravenous valproate sodium (1200 mg) to relieve recurrent GTCS and frequent focal aware seizures. The patient was subsequently prescribed oral levetiracetam (LEV) of 500 mg twice daily once she regained consciousness.

On the second day of admission, routine laboratory studies were conducted, which revealed unremarkable results. The patient’s ECG showed evidence of paroxysmal AF. A carotid Doppler ultrasonography was also conducted, which showed hypoechoic plaques on the anterior wall of the bifurcation of the right common carotid artery.

After 44 hours of admission and a total dosage of approximately 2200 mg of intravenous valproate sodium, the medication was discontinued. An electroencephalogram (EEG) was also conducted, which demonstrated global interictal θ waves (4-7 Hz), but without epileptiform discharges.

On the 3rd hospital day, the patient developed renal dysfunction based on the results of the BUN and serum creatinine levels, which were attributed to insufficient fluid intake. The International Normalized Ratio (INR) was found to be elevated, leading to the cessation of oral warfarin medication. A 5mg dose of vitamin K1 was administered intravenously following consultation with a hematologist. The patient remained asymptomatic and was observed without any evidences of bleeding. The repeat brain CT scan also revealed no intracranial hemorrhage. The renal dysfunction was resolved on the 4th day.

Discharge:

The patient was discharged on [Date], with oral warfarin cautiously restarted at a dose of 1.25 mg and titrated back to 1.875 mg while monitoring the INR between 2 and 3.

Follow-up:

The Neurology department recommended a follow-up with the patient in one week to monitor the improvement of her condition. The patient was advised to keep up with the fluid intake and attend regular INR monitoring sessions to check the therapeutic window of warfarin. The patient was also advised to continue taking isosorbide mononitrate and succinate metoprolol for her cardiovascular ailments.

Discharge medications:

1. Isosorbide mononitrate sustained release tablets (40 mg oral) daily.
2. Succinate metoprolol tablets (12.5 mg oral) twice daily as needed.

The patient, a 48-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse, presented to the gastroenterology department in November 2006 complaining of severe epigastric pain and nausea for two days. The laboratory findings were suspicious for pancreatitis and the patient underwent computed tomography (CT), which showed an edematous pancreas tail and fluid in the anterior prerenal space and fascia. He had two similar episodes of acute tail pancreatitis in the following months. 

In September 2009, the patient presented with vague epigastric pain of several weeks duration. Serum amylase and lipase levels were normal, but the cholestatic parameters were mildly elevated. A magnetic resonance (MR) study was performed, which demonstrated moderate chronic pancreatitis of the tail with atrophy and irregular bordering of the Wirsung’s duct. Helicobacter pylori gastritis was also diagnosed. 

In February 2012, the patient presented again to the gastroenterologist with epigastric and left upper quadrant pain. Contrast-enhanced CT scan was performed to evaluate the known chronic pancreatitis and other causes of pain. The study surprisingly revealed a hypervascular lesion in the pancreatic tail consisting of a conglomeration of small hypervascular spots and blood vessels. Further examinations were performed in order to differentiate a vascular malformation from a hypervascular pancreatic tumor, especially an islet cell tumor or a hypervascular metastasis. Contrast-enhanced MR study showed a focal area of heterogeneous contrast enhancement without an apparent nodular component. The subsequent angiography showed two large feeding arteries in the early arterial phase, followed by a racemose vascular network, an early transient dense parenchyma stain in the early portal phase and early wash-out of the lesion in the portal phase. Based on these findings, a pancreatic arteriovenous malformation was suggested. 

The patient underwent resection of the pancreas tail and postoperative recovery was uneventful. Histopathologic examination revealed sequelae of chronic pancreatitis and numerous dilated blood vessels accompanied by blood clot formation and intimal hyperplasia. The histopathological findings were consistent with a pancreatic AVM.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient presented with a progressive eruption of cutaneous papules and nodules. The medical history reported nodules/papules on the hands 7 years before, for which she successfully received prednisone in the Philippines with only a few residual lesions. Recently, over a course of 2 months, she noticed an increasing number of cutaneous nodules and papules; starting on her hands subsequently spreading to her wrists and forearms. Pain arose from these nodules when bumped onto a surface.

The patient also suffered from pain and stiffness in hands, feet, elbows, shoulders and knees. Over these 2 months she felt increasingly tired. Apart from these symptoms, a few patches of grouped, flat, red/brown papules were seen on the inner side of the upper arms, on the hips, thighs and neck.

During the patient's hospital course, numerous firm, either reddish-brown or skin-colored papules and nodules were seen and felt mainly on the hands and forearms, varying in size from 0.5 to 1 cm. In addition, papules were found in pre-existing scars on the left shoulder and both knees. On clinical examination, pain was present on palpitation of many of the small hand joints, wrists, elbows and knees. Arthritis was present in several PIPs and in the wrist. Furthermore, her face appeared to be swollen. Laboratory examination revealed a normal level of ESR, negative ANA and anti-CCP antibodies and the IgM Rheumatoid factor was borderline positive.

Punch biopsies were taken from the nodules on the hands and from the plaque on the upper arm. Initially, a histological pattern of dermal scarring/fibrosis was found, without histological features of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. However, additional biopsies showed CD-68 positive macrophages and eosinophilic granulocytes between the collagen fibers in the dermis, in agreement with a form of non-Langerhans histiocytosis.

The PET/CT scan revealed FDG-avidity in the muscles of the thighs and buttocks, the corresponding points were painful to the touch according to our patient. Also, painful joints showed slightly more uptake when compared to the representative opposite joints.

The therapy consisted of prednisone, methotrexate and risedronate together with folic acid and calcium/vitamin D. Prednisone was started on 30 mg and tapered to 7.5 mg in 9 weeks. Methotrexate was introduced to a final dosage of 25 mg/week over 8 weeks. Risedronate was chosen as bisphosphonates are considered to be of additional benefit in the treatment of multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. After 8 weeks of therapy, the joint pain had subsided and our patient was better able to move without pain. The skin lesions, however, persisted over these first 2 months of therapy.

Malignancy became very unlikely after laboratory tests, ultrasound of the abdomen, mammography, PET/CT scan and an additional MRI scan for further imaging of suspicious lesions in one of the mammae.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 34-year-old primigravida, presented with a complicated pregnancy that required an emergency c-section at 36 weeks due to severe fetal distress. Unfortunately, the child was born with several congenital abnormalities and passed away at two months of age due to respiratory failure and multiple associated complications. The team of medical professionals performed several tests, including thoracic X-rays, transfontanelar ultrasound, head CT, muscular biopsy, and tests for aminoacidopathies and spinal muscular atrophy, but the patient's clinical outcomes remained unexplained.

Diagnosis:
Based on the tests and investigations performed, a suspected genetic syndrome that had not yet been diagnosed was deemed the underlying cause. The patient's genomic profile indicated the loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1, 5, and 8, while duplication was present in chromosomes 10 and 16. The patient's parents received genetic counseling, and they agreed to undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT-M). The protocol resulted in two blastocysts available for biopsy, of which one was identified as a carrier of the mother's mutation and the other as WT for both mutations.

Treatment:
The embryo identified as WT for both mutations was transferred to the patient's uterus via frozen-thawed embryo transfer. The patient's pregnancy progressed uneventfully, with regular non-invasive double marker tests and fetal DNA analyses using maternal blood, as well as an invasive amniocentesis at 17 weeks of gestation, indicating a normal genetic profile. All the non-invasive ultrasound scans showed normal growth and organ development throughout the pregnancy, and at 38 weeks, a healthy female baby was delivered via C-section, receiving an APGAR score of 9.

Follow-up:
The patient and her newborn were discharged in stable condition and were advised to follow up with their primary care provider to ensure proper care and support.

Summary:
The patient's complicated pregnancy was due to a suspected genetic syndrome that had not yet been diagnosed. Following IVF with PGT-M, the patient delivered a healthy female baby, and both were discharged in stable condition.

The patient, a 61-year-old female with a history of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, was admitted to the hospital for recurrent chest pain and fatigue. She was evaluated for worsening anemia, and her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed an RSR pattern in V1 and V2 leads. A stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) was negative for cardiac ischemia. A transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an atrial mass attached to the anterior wall of the left atrium, and further characterization by transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) revealed a solid, partly mobile mass attached to the atrial septum and extending to the anterior mitral valve leaflet.

Diagnosis:
The patient underwent a minimal incision valve surgery for resection of the mass, which was presumed to be myxoma based on its location. Intraoperatively, it was noted that the mass originated from the fossa ovalis region of the interatrial septum and infiltrated the atrial wall down onto the entire anterior leaflet of the mitral valve. The mass along with a portion of the interatrial septum and the mitral valve was resected. The mitral valve was replaced using a bioprosthetic valve.

Follow-up and Concerns:
Two weeks after discharge, the patient returned to the emergency room with cough, diaphoresis, and palpitations. She was found to be in acute heart failure and was diagnosed with severe mitral regurgitation with paravalvular leak. The histopathologic examination of the atrial mass showed a high-grade sarcoma consistent with dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Blood cultures were obtained with suspicion of postsurgical infective endocarditis causing valvular dehiscence, but cultures did not grow any bacteria. Due to high suspicion of metastatic disease, MVR and cardiac transplant were not offered until further evaluation for metastasis. Unfortunately, due to rapid clinical decline with a new diagnosis of high-grade cardiac tumor with possible metastases, the patient opted for hospice care.

Summary:
The patient was admitted for chest pain and fatigue, and an atrial mass was discovered and eventually resected during valve surgery. Despite the aftermath of a successful operation, the patient returned to the hospital two weeks later with complications that led to a diagnosis of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Due to rapid clinical decline and the possibility of metastasis, the patient opted for hospice care.",,,0

Age: 39 years
Admit Date: [insert admit date]
Discharge Date: [insert discharge date]

Hospital Course:
Mr. BH was admitted to the hospital after presenting with a Bennett fracture of the first right metacarpal following a work accident. The initial treatment included a reduction and percutaneous pinning using Iselin’s technique. After three weeks, the patient developed an inflammatory reaction around the entry point of the distal pin, leading to early removal of the distal pin. The isolated organism was a methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, and the patient received topical treatment and antibiotics for five weeks based on laboratory results. Bone healing of the Bennett fracture was obtained in the sixth week after the accident, and the proximal pin was removed.

Three months later, the patient returned to the hospital due to persistent pain at the second right metacarpal, accompanied by attacks of inflammation and intermittent purulent discharge. Standard hand X-ray demonstrated the presence of an area of osteolysis surrounded by osteocondensation at the second metacarpal, indicating a focus of osteomyelitis along the path of the distal pin. An MRI confirmed the diagnosis, revealing the extent of the focus of osteomyelitis, the path of the fistula, and the inflammatory extension into neighboring soft tissues.

Surgical treatment called for the induced membrane technique. The first stage included a segmental resection of the area of osteomyelitis through a dorsal approach with excision of the reformed tissue while preserving the index finger extensor tendon. The second metacarpal was stabilized with a mini external fixator, and a cement spacer was interposed. Antibiotic therapy was initiated for six weeks based on sensitivity testing. The external fixator was then removed, and the hand temporarily immobilized with a splint until there was healing along the path of the inserts.

The second stage was performed in the eighth week. The cement spacer was removed, and the biological chamber was filled with a spongy bone graft taken from the ipsilateral iliac crest. Internal fixation was performed with a mini plate while preserving the induced membrane. The postoperative period was uneventful. Bone healing was observed three months later, with complete disappearance of pain. The patient has regained normal use of the hand with a Quick DASH score of 11 and complete mobility. We are currently at the 36-month follow-up, and X-ray of the hand shows incorporation of the graft and evidence of corticalization.

Diagnosis: Grade 4 astrocytoma with molecular studies indicating an IDH-mutated, ATRX mutated, and MGMT promoter methylated phenotype with hypermutation.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 28-year-old male with a history of a grade 3 astrocytoma, presented to the emergency department with a general tonic-clonic seizure. Upon admission, he was found to have disease progression with extension into the splenium and anterior-inferior extension into the left thalamus and basal ganglia. Despite changes to his antiepileptic medication, he had seizure recurrence a few weeks following admission.

A repeat maximal safe resection with GammaTile placement was performed due to presuming that the area of tumor recurrence received a definitive dose in the past. The patient developed right upper and lower extremity weakness/spasticity with right foot drop and mild right face weakness as a result of the surgery. 

After the progression of disease in the splenium and left thalamus/basal ganglia was observed, a treatment plan was made to take the progressive regions of disease outside the irradiated GammaTile volume to 35 Gy in 10 fractions. 

Due to the hypermutation phenotype of his tumor, the patient was started on CCNU and completed his EBRT with no issue or progression of his neurological symptoms. He was last seen in follow-up by our team three months after his most recent EBRT, at which point he reported significant improvement in the right leg tremors/spasms and improved headache. He demonstrated decreased right foot drop but continued to have word-finding difficulties and short-term memory deficits.

Admitting Diagnosis: Pleuresia and Pleural Drainage

Hospital Course: 
A 3-year-old girl was admitted to the hospital with fever and cough. She was diagnosed with pleuresia, and pleural drainage was performed. Antibiotics were prescribed, but the patient did not show any improvement. A CT scan was performed, which revealed a tissular lesion of the left lower pulmonary lobe and a tumor of the right kidney. Lung biopsy showed blastema, without being able to distinguish whether its origin was WT or PPB despite multiple analyses by various pathological experts. Following the recommendations of the national panel of expert of both tumors, the patient was treated for metastatic WT following the International Society of Paediatric Oncology protocol. A nephrectomy was performed after 6 weeks of chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin, with a good response in both sites. The histologic analysis confirmed the diagnosis of WT with an intermediate risk (epithelial type) which was classified as a stage IV. Lung surgery was scheduled several weeks later. During this period, a heterozygous pathogenic variant was identified in exon 23 of the DICER1 gene (LRG_492) using high-throughput sequencing of a panel of genes involved in endocrine tumor development. This variant c.4407_4410del, p.Ser1470Leufs*19, leading to loss of the RNase III active site, has been previously associated with pleuropulmonary blastoma. This led to a high suspicion of associated PPB. Pre-operative workup showed increase in tumor size, and chemotherapy was modified (by adding ifosfamide and doxorubicin) to try to reduce tumor volume and vascularization. After the first course of chemotherapy, the patient developed respiratory distress due to a massive increase in tumor size, leading to mediastinal compression. A left pleuro-pneumonectomy with intra-pericardic ligature of the vessels and without cardiac assistance was performed to remove the left lung. The patient's early postoperative course was uneventful. The pathologist confirmed the diagnosis, and it was a type 3 PPB with R0 resection. Postoperative chemotherapy consisted of eight courses (27 weeks) of vincristine, actinomycin, and doxorubicin. After 1-year follow-up, the patient remained asymptomatic and was considered to be in remission.

Discharge Disposition: The patient was discharged in stable condition.

Condition at Discharge: The patient was stable and was doing well.

Admission Diagnosis: Suspected traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage
Discharge Diagnosis: Distal PICA aneurysm

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to our hospital with a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cerebral infarction ten years prior. She also had a recent minor head trauma that caused a headache. An initial non-contrast brain CT scan revealed minimal subarachnoid hemorrhage on the left ambient cistern with an enlarged ventricle. She was admitted to the neurosurgery department as a suspected case of traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage. The CT angiography showed no vascular abnormalities. After ten days of hospitalization, the patient showed sudden stuporous mental deterioration. A subsequent brain CT scan revealed subarachnoid hemorrhage on all the cisterns, with intraventricular hemorrhage. The patient underwent digital subtraction angiography that revealed a bilobulated distal PICA aneurysm.

Treatment:
The patient underwent coil embolization under general anesthesia. The Right femoral artery puncture was made after left subclavian angiography, in which the left vertebral artery was not visible. A catheter optimized for intracranial access was advanced to the V4 segment of the right vertebral artery to reach the Headway 17 microcatheter to the aneurysmal sac. After deploying the coil in the VA just before the PICA origin, the microcatheter was positioned in the PICA with the help of the coil mass. Additional coil deployment took place after accidentally migrating some of the coil masses to the VA origin. The procedure was completed after the confirmation of PICA occlusion.

Outcome:
The patient recovered fully with supportive care in the ICU after the coil embolization, and follow-up MRI results showed no acute cerebral infarction in the PICA territory. The patient underwent a follow-up angiography a year after the procedure, which revealed no aneurysmal sacs in the distal PICA, and the recanalized VA was located medial to the deployed coil mass.

Care Plan:
The patient will follow up closely with a neurologist for the management of high blood pressure and dyslipidemia to prevent future complications. The patient should avoid any head trauma to prevent similar complications in the future.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of fainting. The patient had no history of medical problems and was not taking any medications. All his test results, such as electrolyte level, hemoglobin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein level were normal. Additionally, his electrocardiogram, 24 hours ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring, echocardiogram, tilt table test, and exercise tolerance test showed no abnormal findings. In the physical examination, the patient did not show any neurological symptoms including motor, sensory, or cognitive deficits. The deep tendon reflex was normoactive in all the extremities. Based on the patient's history and examination results, the cardiologist diagnosed the patient with transient loss of consciousness due to syncope.

Diagnostic Imaging:
To confirm the diagnosis, the patient underwent DCE MRI scans. In the Ktrans map of DCE MRI of healthy control participants, no specific abnormal findings were observed. However, in the patient, bright blue-colored lines were observed within the sulci throughout the cerebral cortex, indicating disruption of the BBB of vessels in the overall cerebral sulci. The quantitative analysis showed that the averaged T2 intensity was 403.95 ± 24.91 (AU) for healthy control and 404.50 ± 24.21 (AU) for the patient, which was not statistically different. The average Ktrans within 10 randomly selected ROIs was 0.000156 ± 0.000099 (minutes−1) for healthy controls and 0.001067 ± 0.000806 (minutes−1) for the patient.

Final Diagnosis: Transient loss of consciousness due to syncope with disruption of the blood-brain barrier.

Hospital Course Summary: 
The patient was admitted with a complaint of fainting while hiking on a cold winter night. After ruling out any underlying medical issues, the patient was diagnosed with transient loss of consciousness due to syncope.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted due to Pulmonary embolism (PEA) as a result of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Surgical treatment including cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was initiated; however, the patient could not be weaned off CPB due to severe residual PH combined with right heart dysfunction. Hence, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was used and the patient gradually recovered from PEA. The patient developed severe secondary left ventricular dysfunction on the basis of right ventricular dysfunction, during ECMO support, which was further managed.

The patient’s condition was stabilized during the postoperative period with comprehensive care, including reducing ECMO flow, increasing vasopressor dose, inhaled nitric oxide and treprostinil treatment, lung protective ventilation, and myocardial oxygen supply improvement. The patient underwent atrial septostomy to decompress the right ventricle, so as to reduce the pulmonary arterial pressure. The patient gradually recovered from ECMO and no longer needed it. Other interventions were initiated, such as reducing tidal volume, initiating positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tracheostomy on POD 13, due to unexpected brain ischemia and luminal infarction. Finally, the patient was transferred to a local hospital for further treatment on POD 16.

Throughout the hospitalization, the patient received comprehensive care and support. The patient was closely monitored and managed by an interdisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.

Significant Procedures: Tracheotomy

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 52-year-old Caucasian woman, presented to our Emergency Department with acute respiratory failure in July 2017. She had a previous history of smoking and breast carcinoma. After initial evaluation, it was thought that chronic hypercarbia, caused by a broncho-pulmonary disorder, was responsible for her symptoms. However, a series of tests, including a muscle biopsy, revealed that the patient actually had Glycogen Storage Disease type 2 (LOPD).
After the diagnosis, the patient received enzyme replacement therapy with recombinant human alglucosidase alpha (rh-GAA), which enabled her to be transferred to the Unit of Respiratory Rehabilitation. In the following months, she showed a progressive clinical improvement, with a gradual reduction of ventilatory support to night hours only and recovery of autonomous walking. The patient did not develop any anti-rhGAA antibodies, and the response to the replacement treatment remained stable.

Hospital Course:
The patient, an 80-year-old female, was admitted to the clinic with a mass over the superior aspect of the right scapula. The mass, though achy, did not interfere with performing activities of daily living, but had been enlarging over the previous few months. The patient had no local injuries or recent surgeries on the affected side, and denied having weakness in the left arm or trouble with overhead activities. A similar mass on the contralateral side was excised 10 years previously with favorable results. Inspection of the area was unremarkable, but palpation revealed a firm, nonmobile, and nonpulsatile mass, which was slightly tender upon deeper pressure. Shoulder examination showed no signs of rotator cuff weakness or shoulder pain. X-ray revealed narrowing of the posterior glenohumeral joint space, which was consistent with osteoarthritic changes. MRI revealed an elongated cystic lesion arising from the AC joint and tracking medially to superficial and within the trapezius muscle. The lesion measured 2 cm (AP) × 13 cm (transverse) × 1.8 cm (craniocaudad), and had peripheral enhancement. There was also suspected full-thickness tear of the anterior fibers of the supraspinatus.

Treatment:
The patient underwent excision of the mass via a general anesthetic. Careful dissection revealed a stalk emanating from the AC joint, which was identified and dissected free. The mass was removed en bloc, and a distal clavicle excision was performed using an oscillating saw. After the cyst was excised, it was incised revealing thick mucoid content.

She received ventilatory support with a reservoir mask at a rate of 10 liters per minute due to pulmonary CT findings showing inflammatory consolidation with atelectasis. The initial fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) was performed to determine the etiology of the symptoms. Despite treatment with cephalothin and azithromycin, the patient's fever, cough, and hypoxemia persisted. The arterial blood gas values showed a pH of 7.44, PaCO2 of 45 mm Hg, PaO2 of 52 mmHg, and oxygenation index of 247. The patient was started on nasal high-flow oxygen therapy and methylprednisolone was administered for anti-inflammation. On physical examination, the patient was found to have a temperature of 38.3°C, heart rate of 135 beats/minute, respiration rate of 45 breaths/minute, blood pressure of 85/50 mmHg, fatigue, flaring of nares, and decreased respiratory sounds in the left lung.

Diagnostic Findings:

Cardiovascular, neurological, and extremity exams were normal. The ANA and ENA laboratory studies were also normal. Routine blood tests showed Hb 118g/L, WBC 6.25x109/L, N 55.3%, L 37.6%, and CRP 26mg/L. On day 4, pulmonary CT demonstrated inflammatory consolidation with left pleural effusion. The fiberoptic bronchoscopy showed fibrinoid formation in the left upper and lower lobes, consistent with plastic bronchitis. The BAL fluid test did not reveal any other etiology aside from the presence of MP-DNA and Epstein Barr (EB)-DNA up to 1x108 copies/mL and 4.8x105 copies/mL, respectively. Hypokalemia (K 3.28mmol/L) and coagulation abnormalities were also present during disease presentation.

Treatment:

The patient subsequently received a second fiberoptic bronchoscopy to relieve bronchial casts in response to increased patchy shadow shown on chest radiography on day 5. The patient received methylprednisolone at a dose of 10mg/kg/day and gamma globulin at 2g/kg. The methylprednisolone was continued for a total of 11 days, and medical management resulted in an improved fever, lower oxygen demand, and resolution of anoxia by day 6 of treatment. The patient was discharged on the 12th day due to clinical improvement, and follow-up MP-IgM titer demonstrated an eight-fold increase on the 14th day. Cough persisted on the 18th day. The chest X-ray showed complete resolution 48 days after hospital admission.",,,0

Patient: 68-year-old female with deep rectal cancer with lung metastases

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment of deep rectal cancer with lung metastases. The primary tumor was excised via deep anterior rectum resection and classified as moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. Following surgery, the patient underwent several rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for metastatic lesions. Despite treatment, the patient's cancer lesions continued to progress over time, resulting in the development of multiple bone and head metastases.

The patient was treated with various chemotherapy regimens, radiation therapy, and bisphosphonate therapy over the course of several years. The patient received intratumoral VAE treatment for the calvarian skull metastasis, which led to a reduction in pain and tenderness and decreased the size of the metastasis significantly. The patient's other metastases remained stable during the VAE treatment, but later progressed, leading to the patient's death at the age of 74 years.

Medical History:

The patient had a medical history of appendectomy and hysterectomy, and hepatic cysts were present. The patient was also diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 and hypertension and was treated with appropriate medications.

Conclusion:

The patient's treatment for deep rectal cancer with lung metastases involved several rounds of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bisphosphonate therapy, along with intratumoral VAE treatment for the calvarian skull metastasis. Despite the patient's initial response to treatment, the cancer lesions eventually progressed, leading to the patient's death. The patient had a comprehensive medical history, and appropriate treatment was provided for concurrent medical conditions.",,,0

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 55-year-old Malagasy man, was admitted to the hospital with bullous and erosive skin lesions involving his trunk and scalp, which had been present for two months. A complete blood count confirmed microcytosis without anemia while his white cell count and platelet count were normal. Alanine and aspartate aminotransferase were normal but serum creatinine was high. Skin biopsy confirmed suprabasal blisters containing eosinophils and acantholytic keratinocytes. Direct immunofluorescence revealed IgG deposition in the intercellular spaces in the epidermis. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, his serum autoantibody index against desmoglein-1 and 3 was found to be elevated.

Further investigations showed that he had clinical stage I multiple myeloma of the IgG-λ type. The patient's skin lesions regressed significantly after topical applications of corticosteroid ointment; however, three months later, the dermal affliction occurred again. Systemic administration of prednisolone was started and six months later, bone tomography revealed vertebral compression fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine. Anti-myeloma treatment including melphalan and prednisone was started, which resulted in a rapid decline of monoclonal IgG concentration immediately.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient is a 55-year-old male who was diagnosed with chronic prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) by urologists and was referred to our center for pain treatment. During the first consultation, the patient reported experiencing pain, pollakisuria, dysuria, and a foreign body sensation perineally and in the areas of the prostate and anus for over 35 years. Additionally, the patient complained of a burning sensation in the urethra, a slightly reduced urinary stream, and nocturia of varying frequency. 

The patient underwent various specialist urological examinations over the years, including nerve stimulation therapy, empirical antibiotic therapies, analgesics, probatory surgical removal of both seminal vesicles, and an extension surgery on the anus, all of which did not improve the pain or other symptoms. Therefore, urologists referred the patient to our center for a probatory pain treatment with local anesthetics (neural therapy).

The patient was experiencing a particularly severe pain phase at the time of the first consultation with us, and the quality of life was severely affected. The patient was taking an analgesically effective antiepileptic drug, Gabapentin, as well as the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug Diclofenac, the opioid Oxycodone, and the pain-modifying tricyclic antidepressant, Amitriptyline for the past nine years. The National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) resulted in 39 points (pain: 18; urinary symptoms: 10; quality of life impact: 11).

Our treatment consisted of suprapubic injection of local anesthetic (1% procaine) for six times initially once a month, and bimonthly later, which was performed on the right and the left with infiltration of the vesicoprostatic plexus (in line with neural therapy). Just a few minutes after the first injection, the pain decreased significantly and persistently to a level the patient had not experienced in years. The pain and other symptoms continued to decrease with each injection.

At the next consultation after two weeks, NIH-CPSI resulted in 11 points (pain: 3; urinary symptoms: 4; quality of life impact: 4). Relapses occurred less frequently, were significantly lower in intensity, and the duration was significantly shorter with an average of three days. Even the symptom-free intervals were getting longer. The patient reduced Diclofenac and Oxycodone on his own initiative and completely discontinued both drugs after the fifth consultation. After seven treatments, he was also able to stop Gabapentin and Amitriptyline and remained free of discomfort (NIH-CPSI: 0 points), which also had a positive effect on his mental and social integrity.

The patient exhibited no adverse effects, and the treatment was well-tolerated. The patient was discharged after completing the treatment course with no further follow-up appointments scheduled.",,,1

Patient 2 is an 81-year-old lady who was admitted for treatment of WM (IgMkappa paraprotein). During her stay, capillary zone electrophoresis showed the development of gamma heavy chain disease (γ-HCD). Urine immunofixation identified the presence of γ-heavy chain and kappa light chain. Further tests confirmed the presence of an IgMkappa paraprotein.

The patient's biochemistry and hematology before and after the development of γ-HCD is provided in the attached Tables. Her total IgG levels were increased at 35.1 g/L during diagnosis of γ-HCD with suppressed IgA. The IgG1 subtype was elevated, and other IgG subtypes were decreased or at the lower reference range. The ratio of ((IgGkappa + IgGlambda)/total IgG) was 0.096.

Bone marrow testing indicated the presence of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma/WM. CD5, CD20, and partially CD79a were expressed by lymphoma cells, while plasma cells expressed CD10, CD23, CD56, and CD138. A second CD56+ plasma cell clone that produced γ-heavy chain was also identified.

Admission Diagnosis:
The 5-year old female was admitted with progressive deterioration in her motor and mental function. Her previous medical history was unremarkable, with no obvious signs of illness up to 2.5 years of age. However, from the age of 2.5 years, after suffering a little finger injury, the patient exhibited a gradual loss of speech and communication abilities. At 3.5 years she developed stereotypic movements. MRI revealed diffuse white matter lesions and hypoplasia of the lower cerebellar vermis. A diagnosis of Rett syndrome was initially suggested, but subsequent tests failed to reveal any abnormalities. At 5 years 8 months, the patient was admitted with a severe deterioration in her motor and mental function.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with no interest in environment, no play activity, absence of orientation in space and time, and disturbed speech and understanding of speech. Her condition further deteriorated, leading to myoclonus in her hands, legs and facial muscles. Tactile stimulation was found to enhance the myoclonus. The patient was unable to walk, stand, or crawl, only able to hold her head, roll over, and sit with periodic falls. An ophthalmological assessment revealed partial atrophy of optic nerves, nistagmus, retinitis pigmentosa and mixed astigmatism. An EEG revealed a significant delay in the formation of cortical electrogenesis and poorly-structured epileptiform activity. MRI revealed cortical atrophy, periventricular leukopathy of both hemispheres of the brain and atrophy of the cerebellum. An ECG showed severe sinus bradyarrhythmia and a variable heart rate.

Discharge Diagnosis:
The patient was discharged with a diagnosis of progressive neurological disease, with no specific known etiology.

Hospital Course in brief:
The patient presented initially with a gradual loss of speech, followed by the appearance of stereotypic movements. Further deterioration led to an inability to walk or crawl, the presence of myoclonus, retinal abnormalities and arrhythmia. Upon discharge, the patient was diagnosed with a progressive neurological disease, with no known root cause established.

Summary:
In summary, the 5-year old female patient was admitted with gradually progressive neurological deterioration, resulting in a severe reduction of her speech, motor function and overall communication abilities.

Patient A1 was diagnosed with severe MTHFR deficiency, a rare inborn error of metabolism. He presented with low methionine levels and high homocysteine levels on California state-expanded newborn screening. Following the initial diagnosis, the patient received betaine and cyanocobalamin for his cobalamin synthesis defect.

Despite the prescribed treatment, there were concerns that the family did not consistently adhere to medication instructions. The family also demonstrated a limited understanding of genetic diseases and metabolic management recommendations, and there were language barriers that made communication difficult.

Throughout the patient's clinical course, there were clear neurological concerns, including microcephaly, hypotonia, and subclinical abnormal movements. The patient was admitted to the PICU at 11.5 months of age due to pneumonia and respiratory failure. The patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and he became poorly responsive to environmental stimuli.

Brief Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of fever and severe right-sided headache for two weeks. Physical examination revealed tenderness over the right mastoid bone, and a provisional diagnosis of acute mastoiditis was made. Further evaluations were conducted which included neurology, endocrinology, and ophthalmology consultations, fundoscopy, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain.

Routine investigations were normal, except for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and a positive Mantoux test. A bone scan was conducted, showing asymmetric uptake with increased radiotracer accumulation in the right temporal bone posteriorly, and the patient was worked up for tuberculous OM.

A High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the temporal bone revealed mild sclerosis and cortical destruction involving the right temporal bone.

The patient underwent right cortical mastoidectomy, during which a mass with soft cheese-like material was found on the sigmoid sinus bony plate, misleading the diagnosis as lateral sinus thrombosis. The disease was cleared overall, and the sigmoid sinus was found to be normal with good flow. Tissue was sent for histopathological examination which revealed Mucor mycosis-induced OM of the right temporal bone.

Postoperatively, the patient was treated with Amphotericin-B (liposomal) and voriconazole, and follow-ups were conducted. The patient was free from symptoms after three weeks, and post-operative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance venography (MRV) after six months showed post-canalised sigmoid sinus of the right side with good flow contour.

Patient: 42-year-old female

Medical History:

The patient presented with a primary complaint of pain in the left side of her face for 3 years. She had a history of burning, a pricking type of dysesthesia, intermittent in nature and radiating to the left temporal and orbital region. The unremitting nature of pain often made her feel anxious and agitated with lack of sleep. An array of investigations was performed ranging from MRI brain, OPG, and cephalograms that turned out to be inconclusive.

Hospital Course:

On clinical examination, a sharp localized pain in the hamular region was evident on palpation due to the elongated hamular process that had a knife-edge bony projection. The overlying palatal mucosa had no change in color or texture. A local anesthetic infiltration was injected with subsequent impermanent relief of symptoms in a localized area.

Following a failure of conservative remedies in the past, a prominent elongated hamular process noticed on a cone beam computed tomography and a positive diagnostic block, we opted for a surgical shaving in pursuit of pain relief.

The patient underwent a longitudinal incision of the mucosa and dissection up to the pterygoid hamulus followed by resection of the hamulus from its base. The gross specimen measured 13 mm in length and its shape resembled an arrowhead.

Postoperative Course:

The patient recovered well and was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with the treating physician.

Summary:

The patient presented with chronic pain in the left side of her face and underwent surgical shaving of a prominent elongated hamular process for pain relief. The procedure was successful and the patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with the treating physician.",,,0

This is a summary of a 70-year-old male patient who presented to the emergency department after experiencing two brief loss of consciousness episodes following a light meal at home. The patient was evaluated in the emergency department for a fall and was found to have tenderness in both the right and left lower quadrants of the abdomen, with some voluntary guarding. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated moderate hemoperitoneum with splenic laceration as well as a nondisplaced fracture of the 5th metatarsal. The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit, where serial abdominal exams and hemoglobin measurements were performed every four hours. His hemoglobin fell to 8 g/dL but eventually stabilized, and the patient was discharged home on hospital day 3 in good condition.

History and Physical:
The patient denies striking his head, chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or blood in his stools. His past medical history includes coronary artery disease, high cholesterol, and hypertension. On physical exam, the patient had normal head, neck, chest, and neurological exams. However, he had tenderness in the right and left lower quadrant of the abdomen with some voluntary guarding. Orthopedic exam demonstrated tenderness to his right acromioclavicular joint and ecchymosis of his right 5th metatarsal with no deformity and normal range of motion at all joints.

Diagnostic Studies:
Lab studies showed a hemoglobin level of 12.4 g/dL with normal platelets and chemistry studies. Head CT and shoulder and chest radiography were normal. Foot radiography demonstrated a nondisplaced 5th metatarsal fracture. CT of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated moderate hemoperitoneum with splenic laceration.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the intensive care unit and underwent serial abdominal exams and every four-hour hemoglobin measurements. His hemoglobin fell to 8 g/dL at 48 hours after admission but subsequently stabilized.

Patient: 54-year-old postmenopausal woman from Casablanca (Morocco)
Admission date: May 2011
Discharge date: Not Applicable

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our outpatient institution to undergo laboratory testing as part of a routine checkup. The primary complaint was episodic abdominal discomfort. Upon initial testing, the patient's cell count was normal, with a hemoglobin of 14 gm/dl, a total leukocyte count of 8,200/mm and a platelet count of 3,44,000/mm. However, serum lipase, and amylase levels were found to be elevated. Further tests were conducted to diagnose the cause of the increased levels of these enzymes.

Serological tests for hepatitis A, B, and C viruses, and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) were conducted, but they all came out negative. The tumor markers were also normal. Tests for autoimmune diseases were conducted, but there was no significant deviation from normal ranges. Abdominal ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging scans showed normal pancreas, liver, and biliary tree.

Over the next five years, the patient was continuously monitored, during which there were no symptoms of the disease, though serum lipase and amylase values fluctuated widely. Although lipase concentration never exceeded 2,000 U/L, the lipase median values were 831.5 U/L while the amylase median value was 205.5 U/L.

Hospital Course:

The patient, an eleven-year-old female spayed Labrador Retriever was admitted with multinodular subcutaneous masses in the dorsal cervical area. The masses were diagnosed as grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma, based on the degree of necrosis, cellular atypia, and high mitotic count. The patient underwent surgical excision with 3 cm margins and made a full recovery without any complications. However, ten weeks later, multiple subcutaneous nodules were identified at the same site, confirming a recurrence of the sarcoma. The patient underwent a second, broad excision of the injection site with 3 cm margins.

Subsequently, a small cluster of subcutaneous nodules was identified at the excision site fifty weeks after the first surgery, and a third complete excision with 3 cm margins was performed. The patient was given toceranib, a small molecule inhibitor of VEGFr2 and PDGFrβ, at an orally administered dose of 2.1 mg/kg, which was increased to 2.8 mg/kg on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule. No adverse effects were noted during the course of therapy, and the patient's CBC, serum biochemistry profiles, and thoracic radiographs remained normal. The patient remains in remission ninety-three weeks after initial diagnosis.

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with grade 3 soft tissue sarcoma, which recurred twice at the initial injection site.

This is a comprehensive discharge summary for a 55-year-old male of Han nationality who was admitted to our hospital with symptoms of irritation, pain, and hyposesthesia in the left eye. Patient's presenting complaints were initially diagnosed as viral keratitis at a local ophthalmic clinic. However, after 4 days of antiviral therapy, no significant improvement was observed, and the patient was eventually referred to our hospital. Upon admission, the patient presented with conjunctival hypertrophy and infiltrated growth into cornea about 2 mm from the nasal limbus, microvascular tissue hypertrophy of about 2.5 mm across the corneal limbus, and hyperemia grayish-white infiltrate of cornea about 5 mm in diameter.

Diagnostic Approach:

The patient underwent direct microscopy of corneal scrapings stained with Gram and KOH preparation, which yielded negative results for organisms. The patient was then prescribed empiric fortified topical and systemic antibiotics, including ornidazole, tobramycin, vancomycin, natamycin, and fluconazole. However, after three days, there was still no noteworthy improvement, prompting the decision to perform an excision of pterygium and therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty in the left eye. Cultures of the patient's corneal tissue for bacteria, fungus, and Acanthamoeba were negative. Because there was evidence of increased keratoneuritis, antiamebic therapy (chlorhexidine) was initiated, and voriconazole was also added. Yet, twelve days after the surgery, corneal opacity was rescraped, and the infiltration extended deeply into the anterior chamber. A second penetrating keratoplasty was performed, virtually limbus to limbus, along with an intracameral amphotericin B injection. 

Outcome:

The patient's medical condition did not improve. 10 days after the second operation, the infection spread to the adjacent sclera and progressed to endophthalmitis, necessitating enucleation. Eventually, the corneal cultures growing on PDA plate were identified as P. insidiosum by MALDI-TOF-MS, confirming the diagnosis of pythiosis.

Discharge Condition:

The patient has been discharged, and his overall condition is stable. The patient was advised to follow up with an ophthalmologist for further management and rehabilitation.",,,0

Hospital Course:
An 11-year-old Taiwanese girl was admitted to our hospital in May 2013 with fever, dyspnea, and impending respiratory failure. Physical examination revealed several nodular lesions on the abdomen and an enlarged nodular lesion over the right shoulder. Complete blood count showed high leukocytosis with 78% segmented neutrophils. C-reactive protein level was very high, and serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated. High-resolution computed tomography showed multiple lung opacities, mediastinal, cervical, and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathies. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed no lymphoma cells, but lymph node biopsies confirmed ALK+ ALCL diagnosis. Treatment involved chemotherapy with several alternating regimens. After initial treatment with intravenous dexamethasone and cyclophosphamide, and intrathecal administration of methotrexate, cytarabine, and hydrocortisone, the patient achieved complete remission after 4 months. New skin lesions were later noted in the lower back, and ALCL relapse was confirmed by skin biopsy 28 months after the initial treatment. Further treatment consisted of chemotherapy with high-dose CHOP alternating with one course of standard ESHAP. After completion, the patient underwent allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Before transplantation, the patient had residual skin lesions suggesting a partial remission, and bone marrow biopsy revealed no residual lymphoma cells.

Patient: 76-year-old male with hypertension and deep vein thrombosis

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the oncology clinic in June 2016 after routine blood work revealed low white blood cell and platelet counts. A bone marrow biopsy showed normocellular marrow with no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome. He was treated with steroids but did not respond. In February 2017, blood tests showed further decreases in blood cell counts, and a second bone marrow biopsy in March 2017 revealed 20.8% blasts with hypercellular bone marrow. Therefore, he was diagnosed with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).

Treatment:

The patient received the standard first-line induction chemotherapy regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin in March 2017 but showed no response in the subsequent bone marrow biopsy performed 14 days after chemotherapy initiation. In view of his refractory AML, he chose not to undergo re-induction attempts involving intensive chemotherapy. He was offered salvage chemotherapy with the less-toxic AZA, which he agreed to. The subsequent bone marrow biopsy performed in April 2017 showed a positive response, and subsequently, he received nine more cycles of AZA.

ADMISSION DATE: January 2018
DISCHARGE DATE: N/A

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 47-year-old female of Chinese ethnicity, was admitted in January 2018 due to persistent cough and breathlessness. A chest CT scan revealed multiple abnormalities in both lungs, including a large mass on the upper right lobe. Nodular thickening of the interlobular septa and fissures, along with bilateral pleural effusions and lymphadenopathy, were also observed. After testing, the patient was diagnosed with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with extensive dissemination in the chest. A next-generation sequencing conducted on malignant pleural effusion (MPE) identified a SDC4-ROS1 fusion gene, and the patient was orally administered crizotinib, after which the symptoms improved significantly.
 
However, on the tenth day of medication, the patient had a low-grade fever and slight aggravation of dyspnoea, and a chest CT re-scan revealed multiple new-onset ground-glass opacities and consolidations throughout both lungs. The patient was then treated with cefoperazone/sulbactam to exclude the possibility of infection. A re-examination of blood tumour markers, and characteristics of hydrothorax, combined with percutaneous lung biopsy, showed acute lung injury and the pathological stage was assumed to be a transition from exudation to organization. Accordingly, MP pulse therapy (0.5 g once per day) was immediately substituted for the original crizotinib treatment and applied for three days. 

However, due to progressive deterioration leading to respiratory failure, the patient was tracheally intubated and mechanically ventilated. All necessary and additional treatment procedures were conducted to prevent ILD. The patient died 20 days after the first administration of crizotinib. Upon approval of the family, a next-generation sequencing analysis of a lung biopsy sample was performed, which revealed a de novo exon 19 deletion mutation in EGFR, not detected in MPE before treatment with crizotinib. On the other hand, the frequency of ROS1 rearrangement decreased after crizotinib treatment.

Patient Information:
Name: Not provided
Age: 11 years
Sex: Female
Diagnosis: Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (AFH)

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with a subcutaneous nodule in the iliac region, which was asymptomatic. After one year, the nodule gradually increased in size, prompting the patient to visit a nearby hospital where an MRI revealed a 4.3- × 4.1-cm tumor. A non-specialized surgeon performed an unplanned marginal resection, after which MRI showed no evidence of tumor residue. The patient was then referred to our hospital where the histological specimen was investigated again using hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining.

Clinical Findings:
On H-E staining, proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with enlarged nuclei was observed, with stroma composed of fibrous tissue. Pseudoangiomatous spaces filled with blood and surrounded by tumor cells were also noted, along with lymph nodes surrounding the tumor. Immunohistochemical findings revealed positive staining for CD68, CD99, CD56 (focally), and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Staining for CD34 was positive only in the blood vessels, whilst staining for Bcl-2 was only focally positive within the lymph nodes. Staining for S-100 was negative. The patient was diagnosed with AFH, based on these findings.

Treatment:
The patient underwent an additional extended resection. Skin and one layer of the underlying iliac muscle were resected, as the tumor involved the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which had to be excised along with the tumor. Closure of the membrane of the iliac muscle was performed. There was no evidence of tumor on macroscopic examination of the resected specimen, which was confirmed by histological examination.

Follow-Up:
The patient has remained disease-free for 3 years since treatment. However, perceptual disorders of the femoral front have remained.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient is advised to follow up regularly with their primary care physician to monitor any changes or symptoms. The patient should engage in normal daily activities as tolerated.

The patient, a 31-year-old gravida 2 para 1, presented for prenatal ultrasonography at 36 gestational weeks with a suspicion of fetal thoracic wall defect. Prenatal ultrasonography revealed a fetal thoracoabdominal wall defect with partial displacement of the left ventricle and liver, as well as indications of intracardiac malformations.
The patient was admitted to the Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinic in Târgu Mure at 39 gestational weeks, where she underwent a cesarean section. The male newborn had a superior abdominal wall defect, a partial extrathoracic displacement of the heart, and a partially herniated liver with diastasis of the sagittal suture. Postnatal echocardiography confirmed the prenatal diagnosis and also showed a large ventricular septal defect, hypoplasia of the pulmonary artery, and great arteries originating from the left ventricle with the aorta situated anteriorly.
The newborn was administered ampicillin, amikacin, fluconazole, prostaglandin E, and phenobarbital (due to multiple seizures) while admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. During the first week of life, the newborn experienced multiple episodes of bradycardia and low oxygen saturation despite undergoing orotracheal intubation. Surgical intervention was postponed until hemodynamic stability was achieved.
The newborn underwent surgical intervention at 14 days of age, involving replacement of the heart inside the thorax via a systemico-pulmonary shunt procedure, ligature of both persistent arterial canal and pulmonary artery trunk, and repair of the diaphragm defect. The abdominal wall defect was also sutured, but the thorax remained open. The newborn developed tachyarrhythmia and low cardiac output postoperatively, leading to progressive hemodynamic deterioration, metabolic acidosis, and hypoxia. The newborn passed away 5 hours postoperatively.

Patient: 76-year-old man
Medical History: Chronic hepatitis C infection, diabetes requiring insulin, and history of medial sectionectomy for HCC in 2009.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent left lateral sectionectomy as the third operation for recurrent HCC at segment III of Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) TNM staging stage IB (T1bN0M0) diagnosis. Laboratory data indicates high des-gamma carboxyprothrombin (DCP) tumor markers while alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and lectin-reactive alpha-fetoprotein (AFP-L3%) were normal. The patient's liver function was good, with a Child-Pugh score of 5A. 

Two days before the operation, an ICG-NIRF system was used to identify the main intrahepatic metastasis and to search for other tumors in the remnant liver. A fluorescent signal detected the recurrent tumor on the liver surface of segment III, while there was no signal detected on the surface of the future remnant liver (right lobe). Another fluorescent tumor was detected in the greater omentum, which was thought to be a seeding from the previous RFA, but localized and controlled. After left lateral sectionectomy, all fluorescent tumors in each specimen were resected, and the operation time was 141 minutes with intraoperative bleeding of 230 milliliters. 

Final Diagnosis: Moderately differentiated HCC showing the progression pattern of pseudoglandular type, including the bile duct with microvascular invasion for portal vein (vp1). The main tumor included both viable and necrotic areas because of the previous TACE and RFA. Both the abdominal wall and greater omentum lesions were also pathologically demonstrated to be metastases of HCC.

After the surgery, the patient was discharged from the hospital on the eighth postoperative day without any complications, and there has been no further recurrence 14 months after the operation.

Pulmonary function tests demonstrated bronchial obstruction and alteration of gas diffusion. ILD multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) reached a CT pattern of possible usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), which led to the decision to perform surgical lung biopsy. Wedge resection of the right upper and lower lobes was performed by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Both resected lung specimens showed a similar pattern of UIP: fibroblastic foci and honeycombing. In addition, the right lower lobe specimen displayed numerous disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive malignancy without invasion of visceral pleura. Complete resection was obtained without malignant margins.

DIAGNOSIS: 
Interstitial lung disease with subpleural reticulations and bronchial obstruction. Surgical biopsy revealed usual interstitial pneumonia with disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive malignancy.

TREATMENT: 
Nintedanib was started as an antifibrotic treatment owing to pathological confirmation of UIP.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE: 
At the last follow-up in October 2019, that is, 2 years after initiation of nintedanib, clinical, functional (FVC, 130% pred.; TLCO, 61% pred.), and CT scan evaluations were stable. There was no evidence of malignancy progression.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS: 
The patient is advised to continue taking prescribed medications as directed and follow up with the primary care physician on a regular basis. She is also advised to avoid exposure to passive smoking and other environmental irritants to prevent further lung damage. 

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES: 
- Interstitial lung disease
- Bronchial obstruction
- Usual interstitial pneumonia with disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive malignancy. 

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
- Usual interstitial pneumonia with disseminated foci of well-differentiated focally invasive malignancy.",,,0

Date of discharge: N/A

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 53-year-old premenopausal woman, was admitted to our institute in March 2016 with complaints of upper abdominal pain, dyspepsia, and postprandial vomiting. The initial evaluation revealed an increased wall thickness of the pyloric antrum consistent with linitis plastica along with peritoneal carcinomatosis. Multiple biopsies were performed, and histology concluded for metastatic breast cancer with gastric linitis plastica. A complete breast radiological investigation was performed to exclude any breast abnormalities, and the results were negative. A laparoscopic peritoneal biopsy was also performed to rule out a gastrointestinal origin of the neoplasm, which confirmed breast origin.

After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient did not undergo any surgery. A Witzel feeding jejunostomy was created, and the patient was started on hormone therapy with fulvestrant (500 mg, day 0, 14, and 28 and every 28 days thereafter by intramuscular injection) in April 2016. The patient experienced significant improvement in dysphagia, and CT scan performed after 4 months of therapy showed stable disease.

The patient continued hormone therapy, enteral nutrition through jejunostomy, and periodic radiological evaluations. In January 2017, a new EGDS with biopsies was performed, which confirmed the presence of adenocarcinoma with immunohistochemistry. The patient remained asymptomatic and in good clinical condition (ECOG PS 1) until the last radiological evaluation in February 2018, which showed a stable disease.

Summary:
The patient was admitted to our institute in March 2016 with a diagnosis of gastric linitis plastica and peritoneal carcinomatosis.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient, a 30-year-old Deaf, Hispanic male, was admitted to the hospital after his mother reported that he was behaving oddly and not taking his medication as prescribed. Upon initial psychiatric interview, an interpreter was not present, and the patient was communicating via written responses. He maintained bizarre delusions, but denied current suicidal ideation (SI), homicidal ideation (HI), or auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH).

The patient, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia as a teenager, had been taking risperidone for several years but was tired of continuing the medication due to side effects of drowsiness and weight gain. He reported that he was in an American Sign Language (ASL) school and learning a career in massage therapy. After meeting a girlfriend, he began to develop a sense of independence that he reported his mother disapproved of. This caused an altercation that precipitated his admission.

With the assistance of an ASL interpreter, the patient was answering questions logically with a linear thought process. He reported that he was feeling fine and not crazy, and that all of these events were happening because his mother does not understand Deaf culture. He also conveyed that he did not like to take his meds because they interfered with him being able to drink alcohol and caused drowsiness.

After a family session was completed, the patient was discharged home with plans to follow up with his community psychiatrist. The patients' diagnosis was changed to delusional disorder upon his discharge.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Delusional disorder

Discharge Instructions:
The patient is advised to keep his follow-up appointment with his community psychiatrist and to continue his prescribed treatment as directed. He is encouraged to communicate effectively with his mother and to discuss any concerns with his treatment.",,,0

Hospital Course Summary:
A 58-year-old female patient with past medical history of diabetes and hypertension was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of an enlarging left breast mass that she first noticed three years ago. The patient reported a progressive increase in size of the mass in the past few months along with 34 pounds weight loss over the last nine months. Physical examination revealed a palpable breast mass of approximately 3 centimeters in the tail of the left breast with no other significant physical findings.

Laboratory tests showed normal WBC count, absolute lymphocyte count of 4400/mL, hemoglobin levels within normal range and slightly higher platelet count. Prior mammograms and ultrasounds were inconclusive and did not show any suspicious calcifications or architectural distortions.

The patient underwent percutaneous breast biopsy, which revealed diffuse atypical small lymphocytic cells. Subsequent immunohistochemical staining revealed neoplastic lymphoma cells positive for CD20, CD5, CD23, PAX5, CD4, BCL2, and negative for CD3, CD10, BCL1 and BCL6. The bone marrow biopsy showed diffuse involvement with small lymphocytic lymphoma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) studies revealed trisomy 12 cytogenetic abnormality. CT imaging revealed extensive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.

The final diagnosis was primary small lymphocytic lymphoma of the breast with bone marrow involvement, Stage 4. She was treated with the FCR regimen comprising of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab which resulted in clinical and radiologic remission. The breast mass was no longer palpable, and repeat CT scans did not reveal any evidence of pathological lymphadenopathy.

Discharge Diagnosis: 
The patient was diagnosed with small lymphocytic lymphoma (Stage 4), with bone marrow involvement.

Disposition:
The patient was discharged with stable medical condition.

Follow-up:
The patient was advised to have follow-up visits with her oncologist for regular check-ups and surveillance. She was instructed to follow up with CT scans and other oncologic evaluations per the recommendation of the treating physician. She was also advised to continue taking her regular medications for diabetes and hypertension as prescribed.

The patient, a 41-year-old man, was admitted to our hospital after being accidently detected with a mass on the right lobe of the thyroid. The MRI showed a significantly enlarged right lobe of the thyroid that was suspected to be a thyroid adenoma. The patient underwent a right thyroid resection and dissection because of this. However, the pathology after surgery indicated LCH because immunohistochemistry staining confirmed CD1a (+), S100 (+), CD68 (+), Valentine (+), and thyroglobulin (+). The patient received additional treatment that included radiotherapy of 16 regimens combined with interleukin-2 therapy. The patient regularly monitored the function of thyroid and began to take 50 μg Euthyrox (levothyroxine) per day since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism 3 years after subtotal thyroidectomy.

In 2007, the patient was admitted to our hospital again with the complaint of thirst and polyuria for several months. They were diagnosed with central diabetes insipidus (DI) and received 3 tablets of desmopressin acetate (0.3 mg/day) with improvement of the symptoms. Pituitary MRI showed loss of the pituitary posterior lobe signal and the pituitary stalk was slightly thicker. The thyroid and total bone ECT scan were both normal.

In 2008, the patient was admitted to the hospital again, complaining of pain and distension in the upper abdominal area. Abdominal CT showed diffuse fine nodules on the right hepatic with partly fusion.

HOSPITAL COURSE SUMMARY:

The patient, a 23-year-old female with a history of adjustment disorder and previously treated anxiety disorder, presented to the dermatology clinic with painful, cracked, and peeling lips. Physical examination revealed thick, yellow keratinaceous crusting on the upper and lower lips, sparing the mucosal lip and vermilion border, with associated edema, erosion, and tenderness to palpation. A biopsy from the debrided left lower lip was nonspecific; however, the histopathologic pattern of spongiotic mucositis, in conjunction with the clinical features, suggested an exuberant irritant contact dermatitis, which was consistent with factitial cheilitis.

The patient was subsequently treated for secondary impetiginization with anti-staphylococcal antibiotics and topical antibiotic ointment for two weeks. Additionally, the patient was counseled on avoidance of licking her lips and was referred back to her behavioral health specialist for management of her anxiety disorder. The patient's lip symptoms resolved within one month of psychiatric treatment and cessation of lip licking.

Admission Diagnosis: High-grade sarcoma with positive margins
Discharge Diagnosis: Disseminated intravascular coagulation, acquired hemophilia

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to Instituto Nacional de Cancerología (INC) in Bogotá, Colombia due to the development of a mass in the back region and bilateral vision loss. After an initial clinical exam and biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with high-grade sarcoma with positive margins compatible with myxofibrosarcoma. The patient was examined by clinical oncology, surgical oncology, and radiation oncology services, which indicated that he was not a candidate for chemotherapy, surgical treatment, or radiotherapy because of the extension of the tumor into the upper and lower back and the poor Zubrod performance score.

During inpatient care, the patient developed progressive deterioration of consciousness state, persistent oral cavity bleeding, and laboratory tests showed prolongation of blood clotting time due to the extended partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The mixing study showed PTT fixing with a 50:50 normal plasma sample that lasted for the first and second hour, suggesting intrinsic pathway coagulation factor deficiency and created a clinical suspicion of acquired hemophilia. Additional tests confirmed a diagnosis of acquired hemophilia based on the presence of hidden low-titer inhibitors in the mixing study.

Based on the above findings, oral treatment with an activated prothrombin complex like factor eight (VIII) inhibitor bypassing activity was initiated. A diagnosis of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was made based on hypofibrinogenemia development, continuous elevation of D-dimer levels, and progressive thrombocytopenia. Despite augmentation of the FEIBA dose and transfusion support in the form of red blood cell units and cryoprecipitate along with electrolyte correction, the patient did not have a positive response to treatment. 

Due to the lack of clinical response to management and the impossibility of providing specific antineoplastic treatment, the patient's family agreed to suspend transfusion support and initiate palliative care. The patient, unfortunately, passed away one week after palliative care was initiated.

Patient was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the proximal right posterolateral vaginal wall after presenting with post-menopausal bleeding. Subsequent biopsy demonstrated a 9 mm invasive melanoma and the patient underwent wide local excision with confirmed negative margins. 

Four months later, the patient developed a right periclitoral mass. Positron emission tomography/CT scan at that time demonstrated focal uptake in this area but no regional/distant metastases. Excision demonstrated a large submucosal mass of atypical epithelioid cells with evidence of melanin synthesis, consistent with malignant melanoma.

Given the high risk of both local and regional/distant failure, a strategy of pursuing a combination of immunotherapy and radiation was felt to be reasonable. Radiation was planned with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the vulva and vagina to an initial dose of 45 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction over 25 fractions), and was to be followed by an electron boost to a total dose of 63 Gy (1.8 Gy/fraction over 10 fractions) at the site of the positive margin.

After receiving the first cycle of ipilimumab, the patient started to develop non-painful erythema in the vulvar and perianal area, as well as a pruritic, grade 2 cutaneous eruption that morphologically showed distinct erythematous papules that coalesced into thin plaques over the upper arms, chest, back and face/ears. By the second cycle of ipilimumab, the patient developed a grade 3 skin reaction that was characterized as a moist desquamation with significant oedema, erythema and pain in the vaginal/vulvar/perianal region and was restricted to the radiation field.

Radiation and ipilimumab were held given the severity of the moist desquamation, and the patient was referred to a dermatologist for evaluation of the ipilimumab-associated cutaneous eruption. She was started on topical triamcinolone cream along with a methylprednisone dosepak, followed by prednisone 60 mg daily (tapered over 7 days) with oral diphenhydramine for pruritus as needed. This resulted in significant improvement in her cutaneous eruption and pruritus.

After a 1-month break from radiation treatment, the patient received a third cycle of ipilimumab. She resumed her periclitoral radiation boost without further issues after receiving a fourth cycle of ipilimumab.

At follow-up 8 months post completion of radiotherapy, she had complete resolution of the in-field toxicity and improvement of her ipilimumab-associated cutaneous eruption. Clinical examination and positron emission tomography/CT imaging 10 months after completion demonstrated no evidence of disease recurrence.

The patient has repeatedly expressed satisfaction with her decision to pursue immunotherapy rather than standard chemotherapy to complement her radiation treatment. She admits the initial side effects and intensity of the treatment course were difficult, although she is very pleased with the outcomes and would make the same decision if asked to do so again.",,,0

Patient Name: [redacted]
Gender: Female
Age: 68 years

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the haematology clinic with left-sided above-knee deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which was unprovoked. Her medical history included osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and sciatica. She had undergone a subtotal colectomy with ileorectal anastomosis for large bowel obstruction due to colonic diverticular disease 16 years ago. Additionally, she had a history of consuming alcohol in large amounts until 4 years ago when her daily intake increased additionally. She also had asymptomatic mild thrombocytopenia since 2006 and mild liver function derangement. A portovenous phase CT scan showed bulky enlargement of the left thyroid lobe with multiple nodules. There was an incidental finding of an extrahepatic portosystemic connection, with an enlarged vein arising from the portal vein, and ultimately draining into the left renal vein.

Assessment and Treatment:
During her hospital stay, a full assessment including physical examination was conducted to rule out any clinical signs of chronic hepatic disease or cardiac abnormalities. There was no evidence of hyperdynamic circulation or audible murmurs on auscultation. The liver was not palpable, and there was no free fluid in the abdomen. There was, however, a mildly enlarged spleen, about 2 cm below the left costal margin; this was also confirmed on the CT images. To further investigate the cause of her extrahepatic portosystemic connection, a non-invasive liver screen with immunoglobulins, autoimmune and viral hepatitis markers were done, along with a fibroscan and endoscopy to look for portal hypertension and varices. The fibroscan showed a median liver stiffness measurement value, which was within the normal range to exclude liver fibrosis. The platelet count on the most recent pathology test was also normal.

Outcome and Follow-up:
Given the findings, chronic liver disease and portal hypertension were ruled out, and a long-standing congenital anomaly was suspected to be the cause of her shunt. The patient was discharged back to the care of her general practitioner without any further follow-up planned, as she was asymptomatic with Type II Abernethy malformation.

Hospital Course:

The patient was a 71-year-old male with metastatic CRPC who presented to our hospital with convulsive seizures. Upon admission, his blood pressure was noted to be 90/65, and routine laboratory and endocrinology tests revealed mild liver dysfunction and decreased levels of potassium and cortisol. These results suggested that hypokalemia was associated with abiraterone therapy. The patient was given potassium supplementation and prescribed an increased dosage of prednisone following discontinuation of abiraterone. Additionally, furosemide, which had been used for a prolonged period due to protracted lower extremity edema, was also interrupted. 

The patient showed marked improvement after supplementation therapy, with normalized levels of serum potassium and plasma cortisol. He was discharged two weeks after admission and continued on a regimen of oral prednisone.

DOB: [Date of Birth] 

Hospital Course:

Admitted with anorexia, shaking chills, diaphoresis, hematuria, productive cough, and fever up to 103°F. After examination, the patient was diagnosed with systemic granulomatous disease, possibly due to intra-vesical BCG therapy for high-grade papillary noninvasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder.

Lab Results:

WBC count of 3.6 × 109/L, hemoglobin of 14.4 g/dL, platelet count of 98 × 109/L, alkaline phosphatase of 251 U/L, alanine transaminase of 71 U/L, and aspartate transaminase of 92 U/L.

Diagnostic Tests:

PA and lateral chest X-ray showed increased interstitial markings bilaterally, especially at the bases. Right upper quadrant ultrasound showed mild fatty infiltration of the liver. Liver biopsy and bone marrow biopsy were obtained.

Patient Name: Not provided
Medical Record Number: Not provided
Date of Admission: Not provided
Date of Discharge: Not provided

Reason for Admission:
Patient, a 76-year-old female, was admitted to the Department of Internal Medicine for preoperative control of intractable wheezing before undergoing radical surgery for thyroid cancer.

Past Medical History:
The patient has a medical history of diabetes, hypertension, and pollen allergy. She was also diagnosed with adult-onset asthma and was undergoing Step 4-5 therapy for long-term management.

Hospital Course:
The patient was prescribed Spiriva Respimat and subcutaneous injections of 300 mg anti-IgE antibody omalizumab every 2 weeks, in addition to her pre-existing anti-asthmatic drugs. This was done to improve the management of asthma during a 4-week period before surgery.

After 1 week, wheezing disappeared and the patient underwent right thyroid lobectomy with tracheoesophageal resection as scheduled. The patient was switched from Symbicort to nebulized budesonide and a tulobuterol patch after surgery. Spiriva Respimat and omalizumab were continued.

Approximately 3 weeks after surgery, the patient developed respiratory distress and wheezing early in the morning. These attacks could have been managed by additional inhalations of Symbicort, but since the patient had a tracheostomy, it was difficult for her to use inhalation powder Symbicort. Thus, it was suggested to switch to Flutiform aerosol, which is commercially available in Japan, and has a pressurized metered-dose inhaler formulation, minimizing the need for high inspiratory flow rates.

To determine the best device for the patient, inspiratory flow rates were measured using In-Check Dial, Turbuhaler, and the special adaptor of the inhaler. Based on the results, 2 inhalations of Symbicort twice daily up to a total of 8 inhalations/day were prescribed.

The patient's symptoms improved quickly over the course of 2 days after starting 2 inhalations of Symbicort in the morning and evening plus additional inhalations as needed (usually 1 inhalation in the evening). Owing to stabilized asthma symptoms, the patient was discharged on the third day after switching drugs.

Recommendations Post-Discharge:
The patient is advised to consider following up with her primary healthcare provider for continued management of her asthma and other comorbidities.",,,0

- Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
- Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the Coloproctology Division at USF with a complaint of anal lump, fistula, hyperemia, decreased caliber of stool, constipation, and rectal bleeding. The colonoscopy showed perianal rash, peeling skin, warty lesions, and severe stenosis of the anal orifice. Surgical biopsies were performed, which resulted in a diagnosis of atypical Paget cells, suggesting PPD or balloon cells melanoma. The anal orifice stenosis was treated by sphincterotomy. 

Treatment:
Since there was no dermis invasion and no associated colorectal carcinoma, the PPD treatment choice was Imiquimod 5% cream for 12 months. Every 4 months, a new colonoscopy revealed skin condition improvement, and perianal biopsies showed no residual PPD. After the first Imiquimod treatment cycle, two more surgical biopsies were performed, and a new Imiquimod cycle was prescribed. 

Follow-Up:
After 3 months, a third biopsy revealed no sign of lesion. The patient is currently being closely followed every 3 months and remains without signs of recurrence to date. If no lesion is observed, the follow-up may include biopsy from the old perianal lesion once a year and colonoscopy once every 2 years.

Recommendations:
It is recommended that the patient regularly follows up with the Coloproctology Division for post-treatment surveillance. They should attend biopsies from the old perianal lesion once a year and a colonoscopy every two years, in case of any recurrence of PPD.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with symptoms of altered mental status, hypotension, fever, and tachycardia. Upon admission, the patient had a history of end-stage renal disease due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (right permacath) and splenectomy in 2007. The patient was diagnosed with septic shock secondary to Streptococcal pneumonia and was treated with meropenem and vancomycin.

On the third day of hospitalization, the patient reported right-hand pain at the site of the arterial catheter. Further evaluation revealed a swollen and cyanotic right upper extremity with significant right-sided arterial insufficiency. Venous duplex ultrasound results showed a massive thrombus in the axillary, brachial, and basilic veins of the right arm.

Possible diagnoses included catheter-induced venous thrombosis, sepsis-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation, and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia was suspected, and heparin was discontinued immediately while the patient’s peripheral smear and coagulation cascade were investigated. On the fourth day of hospitalization, the heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies and serotonin release assays returned positive, confirming heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

The patient was started on argatroban and managed per the surviving sepsis guidelines. Vascular surgery was consulted to address the gangrene in the second and third digits of the right upper extremity, but due to the patient's critically septic condition with multiple morbidities, a decision was made not to proceed with invasive maneuvers.

On the eighth day of hospitalization, re-evaluation by venous duplex demonstrated normal compressibility and spontaneous flow in the vein of the right upper extremity. The platelet count recovered, and no further thrombotic complications were observed. However, the patient’s second and third fingers were amputated due to advanced gangrene.

Follow-up:

The patient was discharged on the tenth day of hospitalization with instructions to continue argatroban therapy and follow up with vascular surgery and nephrology. Outpatient laboratory testing was recommended to monitor platelet count, hemoglobin levels, and coagulation cascade. The patient was instructed to monitor for any signs of recurrent thrombotic events and to seek medical attention if they occur.

The patient, a 37-year-old male, was admitted to the hospital due to a recurrent tumor that involves the nasopharynx, sphenoid sinus, eroding basisphenoid, and vidian canal. The patient had previously been diagnosed with juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. His medical history includes lateral rhinotomy excision and endoscopic excision surgeries.

During the routine follow-up nasal endoscopy, a fleshy vascular mass was identified in the nasopharynx. Pathological examination of the specimen block showed moderate nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitosis with spindle-shaped tumor cells arranged in intersecting fascicles. Immunopositive cells for smooth muscle actin and a MIB-1 labeling index of 25% confirmed the presence of leiomyosarcoma.

Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a heterogeneously enhancing soft tissue mass lesion in the right posterolateral wall of the nasopharynx measuring 6 × 3.7 × 4 cm. The mass had eroded the adjacent bone and involved the pterygoid muscles.

Due to the extensive involvement of the skull base, surgery was not considered to be appropriate, and the patient was planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (gemcitabine-based) followed by chemoradiation. The patient was discharged after receiving comprehensive care and instructions for the continuation of his medical treatment and follow-up appointments.

History of Present Illness: The patient is a 65-year-old African American male who presented to the emergency department (ED) via emergency medical service with left arm pain that he described as “cramping”. The patient reported that the pain was so intense that he became weak causing him to fall onto the ground. The pain made him feel like “jumping out of the window”. The patient denied any head injury and he had no loss of consciousness (LOC). The patient had no chest, shortness of breath, or dyspnea on exertion. The patient denied any neck, back, or abdominal pain. The patient admitted to intermittent cocaine abuse.

Past Medical History: The patient's past medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, sick sinus syndrome, high cholesterol, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, deep vein thrombosis, chronic kidney disease, hilar mediastinal adenopathy, diastolic heart failure, valvular heart disease, and cardiac arrhythmia of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with a permanent pacemaker.

Physical Exam: The patient had a strong left radial pulse and brisk capillary refill of the left hand with no tenderness or deformity. The patient was noted to have left arm weakness and what looked like choreiform or clumsy left arm movements. His left leg was also noted to be weak. There was no numbness. Interestingly, light touch to any part of the left arm produced significant discomfort to the point where he did not want anything touching the left arm. He was noted to have decreased rapid alternating movements on the left upper extremity as well as mild difficulty with fine motor control. His left arm and left leg motor strength was 4/5. His cranial nerves II to XII were grossly intact. There were no visual fields cuts noted. Extraocular motility was intact. The grimace was symmetric. There was no evidence of double simultaneous extinction.

Diagnostic Studies: The electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia with first degree atria-ventricular block, as well as ST and T wave abnormality suggestive of lateral ischemia. This is however unchanged compared to his ECG from two years previously. His cardiac enzyme was negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head without contrast showed an acute 2.2 cm intraparenchymal hemorrhage with vasogenic edema in the posterior right parietal lobe. X-rays of the upper extremity were unremarkable. The chest X-ray showed normal cardiac silhouette and pulmonary vasculature. The carotid ultrasound showed no hemodynamically significant carotid stenosis and antegrade flow was present in the bilateral vertebral arteries. A CT angiography of the head and neck did not show any aneurysms. His serial cardiac enzymes remained negative throughout his hospitalization. A cardiac catheterization was not performed as the patient had it done one year previously showing angiographically normal coronaries.

Hospital Course: The patient was placed on a continuous nicardipine infusion to maintain a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg as per neurosurgical consultation. He was transferred to a neurointensive care unit. His left arm pain resolved after 24 hours. A cardiology consult was obtained and the patient was found to have no evidence of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or ischemia. He was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

1962,"Hospital Course Summary:

This is a hospital course summary for a 71-year-old Japanese woman who was admitted to Toranomon hospital because of reduced consciousness. She had a history of a mastectomy for right breast cancer. Eight months before admission, she came to the hospital because of partial paralysis of her right hand. A chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass in the left upper lobe, as well as lymphadenopathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed multiple brain metastases. The patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma using transbronchial lung biopsy. She received chemotherapy and radiotherapy but her state of consciousness rapidly worsened in the 2 weeks before admission. 

On admission, lumbar puncture was performed and cytological examination of her cerebrospinal fluid revealed adenocarcinoma cells. Erlotinib at 150 mg/day was dissolved in 15 mL of water, and was administered via a feeding tube because she could not swallow a tablet. At the same time, dexamethasone and glycerin administration were started via drip infusion. The patient’s state of consciousness gradually improved with this treatment. As a side effect of erlotinib, diarrhea of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 grade 2 developed. Three weeks after receiving erlotinib and steroids, the patient started to vomit and suffered from grade 3 diarrhea. At that time, she was diagnosed with pneumatosis intestinalis (PI). 

PI was managed conservatively with a combination of antibiotics and inhalation of oxygen. Two weeks later, the CT findings of PI were improved. Erlotinib was re-administered without steroids, and PI relapsed 4 weeks later with diarrhea. After improving PI by discontinuation of erlotinib and conservative therapies, gefitinib was administered safely without PI and diarrhea for 3 months. At that time, the number of cells in the cerebral fluid decreased with erlotinib and gefitinib, although the cytology was still positive for adenocarcinoma. 

The patient died of worsening brain metastases 8 months after the diagnosis of LM.",,,0

Diagnosis: Nodular goiter

HOSPITAL COURSE

The patient was admitted to our hospital with thyroid nodules under regular ultrasound observation for at least 5 years. The patient underwent a thyroid function test. The test results showed a thyroid-stimulating hormone level of 0.912 uIU/mL, free T3 of 4.61 pmol/L, free T4 of 13.30 pmol/L, thyroglobulin antibody of 14.46 IU/mL, and thyroid peroxidase antibody of 37.61 IU/mL. Following the diagnostic evaluation, the patient was given a principal diagnosis of nodular goiter.

Ablation treatment was planned due to the small volume and benign character of the nodule. The MWA procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a MWA instrument (ECO-100A1; YIGAO Microwave System Engineering Co. Ltd, Nanjing, China), matched aseptic disposable MWA needle (ECO-100AL3; 100 mm in length, 1.6 mm in diameter), and 500 mL normal saline for cold fluid circulation. The output power setting was 35 W with a frequency of 2450 MHz. Ultrasound (GE, LogiQ-E9) was used for guidance before, during, and after the ablation.

After completing the procedure, the patient was advised to remain laying down and abstain from drinking water for at least 2 hours. About 4 hours after the MWA procedure, the patient developed mild miosis and eyelid ptosis in her right eye but no enophthalmos, anhidrosis, or vascular dilatation. Her symptoms became more serious a day later. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and examination by a neurological physician were performed and the patient was diagnosed with Horner syndrome as a rare complication of MWA.

Mecobalamin was administered to the patient immediately for routine treatment. After 42 days of MWA, the patient's nodule showed a reduction in volume with ultrasound. However, after 5 months of follow up, the patient's miosis and ptosis had not been completely alleviated.

Admission Date: October 2016
Discharge Date: N/A

Reason for Admission:
A 50-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with complaints of sicca syndrome, slight pain, and bilateral enlargement of parotid glands for 18 months. She also had progressive bilateral periorbital swelling.

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with Sjogren syndrome in 2015. She had a history of moderate asthma that required treatment with long-acting beta2 agents and inhaled steroids for a few years.

Physical Examination:
The physical examination revealed evident swelling of salivary and lacrimal glands, bilateral yellow eyelids xanthelasmas, and the presence of multiple intra-glandular lymph nodes. 

Diagnostic Tests:
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed patchy diffuse salivary and lacrimal gland enlargement together with the presence of multiple intra-glandular lymph nodes. The high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest revealed a nodular lesion (diameter 3 cm) at the inferior right pulmonary lobe. The bronchoalveolar lavage did not show any pathogenic microorganisms or atypical cells. The endoscopic biopsy failed to obtain diagnostic material. The whole-body positron emission tomography (18FDG-PET-CT) showed a modest increase in fludeoxyglucose up-take of lymph nodes, parotid glands, and oral-rhino pharyngeal mucosa.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease based on the histological examination of an intra-parotid lymph node.

Treatment:
One cycle of 2 g rituximab (RTX) was administered together with methylprednisolone 100 mg single-shot premedication. The patient reported a rapid and complete improvement of exocrine glands swelling, and resolution of asthma. No chronic therapy was prescribed, and no adverse effects were observed.

Follow-up:
The remission persisted at the 12-months follow-up visit and was confirmed by MRI. Furthermore, neither the pulmonary lesion was visible at HRCT nor significant intra-thoracic 18FDG-uptake was detectable at PET control. IgG4-RD responder index stepped down from 14 to 6, serum IgG4 levels roughly halved, and plasmablasts concentration became undetectable.

Summary:
The patient was admitted to our hospital with complaints of sicca syndrome, slight pain, and bilateral enlargement of parotid glands for 18 months. She was diagnosed with IgG4-related disease based on the histological examination of an intra-parotid lymph node. One cycle of 2 g rituximab (RTX) was administered, which led to a rapid and complete improvement of exocrine glands swelling, and resolution of asthma.

Chief Complaint: Erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface

Hospital Course Summary:

Upon admission, the patient presented with erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface after taking a single dose of methampyrone orally. The patient had conjunctivitis, turbid corneal in the bilateral eyes, ulceration of the mouth, and swollen lips. He had generalized skin erythema and irregularly shaped itchy purpuric macules. On examination, the epidermal detachment was observed over 30% of BSA and Nikolsky's sign was clearly elicited with a detachment of the epidermis from lower layers when slightly rubbed, and extension of existing bullae to the clear skin indicated an active TEN.

Treatment started with replacement of fluid loss while maintaining electrolyte imbalance and antibiotic therapy. The patient started methylprednisolone 125 mg TID along with cyclosporine 50 mg BID, but after 2 days of hospitalization, his skin lesions did not show any improvement. The patient's skin change progressions rapidly extended from 32% at hospital admission to 62% of BSA involved with 16% in grade I and 46% in grade II hemorrhagic blisters.

Due to the lack of patient's response to initial therapy, TPE was initiated using the COBE Spectra Apheresis System and a double membrane filtration device via central vascular access. The patient's condition rapidly improved after the completion of the first TPE session, with blistering and extensive epidermal necrosis halting after the second and third session of TPE. Rapid reepithelization occurred by 1 week of the introduction of TPE. The patient made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home in 8 days of hospitalization with good condition. Proper instructions were given regarding a possible relapse and methampyrone avoidance. At the checkup, the lesions had completely disappeared.

Diagnosis: Erythematous skin with severe itching and flaking presented on the entire body surface due to adverse drug reaction to methampyrone, followed by bullous exfoliation of the skin, and diagnosis of active TEN.

Interventions: Treatment for the patient involved replacement of fluid loss and maintaining electrolyte imbalance and antibiotic therapy. The patient started methylprednisolone 125 mg TID along with cyclosporine 50 mg BID, but due to the lack of response to initial therapy, TPE was initiated.

Date of Discharge: [Redacted]

Reason for Admission:
Patient presented to rheumatology clinic with chronic low back pain associated with morning stiffness and worsening throughout the day. He also described increased difficulty with ambulation associated with bilateral paresthesia of the lower extremities, saddle paresthesia, and increased urinary urgency. He was diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis and cauda equina syndrome.

Hospital Course:
While awaiting initiation of therapy, the patient had worsening lower extremity weakness and was admitted three weeks after presentation to the rheumatology clinic. His initial physical exam showed bilateral lower extremity weakness that was worse in the right lower extremity with bilateral diminished reflexes. His initial labs showed an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) of 48mg/L and no leukocytosis. A repeat lumbar spine MRI in the hospital showed no evidence of cord compression. His thoracic spine MRI, however, demonstrated T7-T8 discitis with concern for osteomyelitis but no pathological fracture.

Treatment:
The patient underwent emergent surgical decompression of the thoracic spine from T7 to T10. He was started on empiric vancomycin by the infectious disease specialist. He then had interventional radiology (IR) aspiration of the T7-T8 disc space one week later that revealed rare Gram-negative rods on Gram stain and the infectious disease team started him on cefepime, continuing with vancomycin. The group then decided to complete a six-week course of vancomycin and cefepime prior to starting adalimumab due to the risks of starting immunosuppressive therapy in a patient with possible infectious discitis.

Outcome:
The patient showed a significant improvement in his lower extremity weakness and paresthesia, and his CRP had decreased to 35.6 mg/L upon outpatient following by infectious disease shortly after completing his six-week course of antibiotics. The infectious disease specialist then cleared him to start biological therapy. He started a course of adalimumab at his rheumatologist's office and continued to show gradual improvement in both his ambulation and paresthesia. The patient will continue to be monitored over the next few months by his rheumatologist as he continues adalimumab therapy with repeat thoracic and lumbar spine MRIs in two months.

Diagnoses:
1. Ankylosing spondylitis
2. Cauda equina syndrome
3. T7-T8 discitis with concern for osteomyelitis

Recommendations:
1. Continue adalimumab therapy as prescribed by the rheumatologist.
2. Repeat thoracic and lumbar spine MRIs in two months.

Admitted for: Right ankle pain

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a four-year history of right ankle pain, which worsened as the day progressed and resulted in cramping episodes. The patient experienced paraesthesia on the posterior and medial aspects of the ankle and foot. Initial diagnosis was synovitis, which was treated with physical therapy and yielded no improvement. A positive dorsiflexion-eversion test was observed in physical examination provoking numbness in the foot. Tinel's sign was positive, and ankle range of motion was limited due to pain. The patient had a preoperative score of 40 points according to the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS). Bilateral electromyography (EMG) showed abnormal findings on the adductor hallucis and adductor digiti quinti neurophysiologic parameters compared to the asymptomatic side.

Imaging studies, including plain radiographs and CT scan, revealed the presence of a considerable posterior bone fragment in relation to the talus and an articulated accessory bone. A diagnosis of talus bipartitus (TB) was suspected, which was confirmed with the help of MRI that revealed an inflammatory process, bone fragment covered with cartilage, and a degenerative synchondrosis, leading to posteromedial impingement.

Due to increasing symptoms and unsuccessful conservative treatment, a surgical procedure was indicated. The preoperative assessment included three-dimensional CT scan images for a detailed understanding of the bone fragment's specific anatomy and MRI's assessment of the anatomic relationship between the tibial nerve, posterior tibial artery, flexor hallucis longus, flexor digitorium longus, and tibialis posterior tendon and the bone fragment. However, fixation of the accessory bone was not feasible due to its particular shape.

Excision of the bone fragment was performed, and a medial approach was used to identify and preserve the tibialis posterior tendon and neurovascular bundle. The bone fragment was successfully removed, and the tunnel was released. Postoperative care included cast immobilization and a 30-day weight-bearing restriction. Postoperative radiographs showed the complete absence of residual bone fragments, and histological findings showed mature bone with an articular cartilage surface.

At a 6-month follow-up, the patient reported a score of 2 on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and an AOFAS score of 87. At the 2-year follow-up, both VAS and AOFAS scores were significantly improved, with scores of 1 and 96, respectively. The patient had no residual pain or recurrence of neurological symptoms.

REASON FOR ADMISSION:
Epigastralgia and elevated serum levels of CA19-9 and elastase-1.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was diagnosed with cStage III pancreatic cancer, categorized as an unresectable LAPC. She immediately underwent three cycles of chemotherapy (gemcitabine + nanoparticle albumin-bound paclitaxel) on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. In addition, she underwent Carbon Ion Radiotherapy (CIRT) with concurrent chemotherapy. CA19-9 antigen levels fell within the normal range after three courses of induction chemotherapy and remained within the normal range until conversion surgery. FDG-PET scan did not reveal any hot spots either in the primary tumor or in the entire body.

The patient had clinically and radiologically apparent frequent cholangitis due to unidentified duodenal narrowing, along with peripheral sensory neuropathy due to the nab-PTX regimen, which prevented continued chemotherapy. Nine months after her first visit, we decided to perform conversion surgery. A radical subtotal stomach preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed, and Group 1 and 2 lymph node dissections were also performed while predominantly preserving the nerve plexus around the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Grade B postoperative pancreatic fistula and deep incision surgical site infection were identified as postoperative complications.

Discharge Date: [Discharge Date]

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 44-year-old male, was admitted following investigation for chest pain and dyspnoea. Subsequent physical examination, echocardiography, and computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed aortic root aneurysm of approximately 9 cm, severe aortic regurgitation, and severe aortic coarctation. A multidisciplinary team meeting took place and a consensus was agreed to proceed with a two-staged hybrid approach, with the first phase involving an endovascular approach to stent the coarctation, followed by a second stage to perform the surgical repair of the aortic root aneurysm. The first stage to stent the coarctation was unsuccessful, and the decision was then made to proceed to a single-stage surgical approach to treat both lesions.

Following induction of anesthesia, the patient underwent a right infraclavicular and right groin incision. The aortic root, valve, and ascending aorta were excised, and the coronary ostia were noted to be significantly displaced. Root replacement was performed with a 25 mm biological valved-conduit, and an end-to-side anastomosis was fashioned between the 20 mm extra-cardiac graft (attached to the descending thoracic aorta) and the ascending portion of the valved-conduit. Following rewarming and de-airing, the patient was successfully weaned off cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The patient remained in ICU for less than 48 hours and made excellent progress on the ward. At 3 months follow up the patient underwent a repeat CTA scan which showed complete patency in the extra-anatomical graft and resolution of the collateral arterial network.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Age: 73
Gender: Male
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Brief Hospital Course: 
The patient presented with symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection and was admitted to the hospital for nearly three months. Throughout his stay, the patient underwent various treatments, such as dexamethasone, azithromycin, and ceftriaxone, to cover the complications caused by COVID-19. He was intubated for most of his stay and treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to combat ventilator-associated pneumonia. Unfortunately, his gastrointestinal bleed and pulmonary embolism made it difficult to provide optimal treatment, and his respiratory status eventually declined, leading to prolonged hospitalization. During the second month, the patient tested positive for T. asahii in his urine sample. 

Diagnostic Tests and Procedures: 
The patient underwent multiple diagnostic tests and procedures, including sputum and urine cultures, chest X-rays, esophagoduodenoscopy, and colonoscopy. Pathologic reports suggested that the biopsy material from a colon mass could not exclude the presence of an advanced malignant lesion. 

Course in Hospital: 
During his hospitalization, the patient required continuous care, which included long-term antibiotic treatment for ventilator-associated pneumonia and medication to manage T. asahii infection. He was started on fluconazole initially, followed by voriconazole after specific resistance patterns were determined. The patient underwent a tracheostomy and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement without complications. 

Discharge Condition: 
The patient's condition deteriorated to the point where palliative care was initiated at the long-term care facility. He eventually expired at the facility.

Follow-Up: 
As the patient has passed away, no follow-up care is necessary.

Summary: 
This 73-year-old male patient with a history of COPD, hypertension, and cerebrovascular accident presented with COVID-19 infection and developed complications. The prolonged hospital stay included antibiotic treatments to cover for ventilator-associated pneumonia and treatments for T. asahii infection, with multiple diagnostic tests performed to manage the patient's condition. Despite continuous care, the patient's condition deteriorated, leading to palliative care and eventually passing away.",,,0
833,"Hospital Course:

The patient, a 45-year-old male, presented with right lumbago accompanied by a lower echo mass in the lower pole of the right kidney. The patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent B mode ultrasonography, which revealed a tumor with a size of 5.4 × 4.8 cm, a regular shape, and an uneven internal echo. A round tumor of the same size was further confirmed by middle abdomen plain and enhanced CT. Subsequently, laparoscopic radical nephrectomy was performed to open the right kidney to remove the tumor.

Diagnosis:

The tumor was determined to be a translocation of XP11.2 tumor associated with pigment differentiation and showed a low malignant biological behavior. Immunohistochemistry revealed that it was positive for HMB45, Melan-A, S100, Ki67, and TFE3. 

Follow-up:

After the surgery, the patient remained stable with no recurrence or complications within the 3-month follow-up period. No other treatments were administered to the patient at this time.

Admitting Diagnosis: Bleeding from the prolapsed uterus

Clinical Synopsis:
An 80-year-old female was admitted with bleeding from the prolapsed uterus. The patient had a history of 3 vaginal births, the most recent one at the age of 30. Upon admission, a large portion of the vagina containing the cervix and part of the uterine body was found below the vaginal introitus (International Continence Society grade 3). Further examination revealed an exophytic infiltrating lesion covering the entire surface of the hypertrophic cervix spreading to the vaginal fornices.

Diagnostic Procedure:
The lesion in the cervix was sampled, and a rectoscopy was performed with sampling of the anal canal lesion for histopathology. The microscopic examination revealed, in the cervical specimen, moderately differentiated invasive squamous cell carcinoma, featuring a strong and diffuse immunohistochemical p16 reaction in the neoplastic cells. In addition, the microscopic examination of the biopsy specimen from the anal canal lesion revealed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma. MRI was also performed and revealed prolapsed cervix of irregular morphology, multiple low T2 signal round myometrial lesions suggestive of uterine fibroids, and an irregular mass-like thickening of the distal part of the rectum and anal canal.

Treatment:
The patient underwent a radical vaginal hysterectomy with extensive colpectomy preceded by laparoscopic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy, followed by radiotherapy. The patient did not consent to the anal extirpation due to personal reasons.

Discharge Condition:
The patient has been discharged in stable condition.

Medications:
The patient has been given appropriate medications. Please consult the medication list in the electronic health record.

History of Present Illness:
The patient was referred to the Oral Pathology and Medicine Unit due to white oral lesions that were initially thought to be a fungal infection. The patient received treatment based on topical antifungals without significant clinical improvement. Clinical examination showed a thickened hyperkeratosis which was confluent in widely exophytic papillary plaques. These lesions appeared homogeneously whitish-gray with verrucous surface and localized on the maxillary gingiva and palatal and alveolar ridge mucosa. The biopsy samples revealed exophytic, hyperkeratotic lesions with prominent verruciform or papillary surface and acanthosis forming droplet-shaped epithelial projections into the lamina propria. One portion of the gingival biopsy specimen, previously frozen, was used for DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) extraction. Human papillomavirus DNA presence was confirmed.

Past Medical History:
The patient has had an appendectomy, cholecystectomy, and tonsillectomy. The patient has never smoked or used drugs recreationally and does not drink alcohol.

Hospital Course:
The excision of the lesion has been performed under local anesthesia using a diode laser set at 1.5 W and a pulse length of 20ms. No postoperative complications were observed, and a periodic follow-up every 6 months has been scheduled. At the last oral examination, 2 years after surgery, we found no signs of loss of alveolar process in correspondence of the surgical ablation site, whereas a mild hyperkeratosis of the maxillary vestibular gingiva was clinically objectified. The microscopic examination performed on a tissue specimen taken in the same area of the laser treatment showed no signs of epithelial dysplasia.

Hospital Course:
This patient presented with a slowly growing abdominal lump with no other symptoms except for fullness of the abdomen after taking food and weight loss. Clinical examination revealed a large, non-tender, soft cystic swelling occupying the entire upper abdomen. On radiological investigations, ultrasonogram (USG) showed a complex cystic mass with internal septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen showed a large multiseptated cystic lesion occupying almost the entire abdomen and adhered to the pancreas with mass effect. The lesion was well defined, lobulated, hypodense in nature, and associated with main pancreatic duct dilatation. USG-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) revealed straw-colored aspirate with mature lymphocytes. After the complete preoperative workup, the patient underwent surgical exploration. On exploration, there was a large multiloculated cystic lesion extending through gastrocolic omentum, pushing the stomach up and transverse colon downwards with hundreds of cystic spaces containing lymphatic fluid. Cysts were decompressed, and the entire lesion was excised. The anterior surface of the pancreas was forming the base of the lesion. Postoperatively, the patient had continued lymphatic discharge from the abdominal drain, and the patient was discharged with it.

Clinical Findings:
On radiological investigations, ultrasonogram (USG) showed a complex cystic mass with internal septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) abdomen showed a large multiseptated cystic lesion occupying almost the entire abdomen and associated with main pancreatic duct dilatation. USG-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) revealed straw-colored aspirate with mature lymphocytes. The final histopathological examination showed unremarkable pancreatic tissue with attached lesion consisting of dilated lymphatic spaces with lymphatic follicles in the wall, with congested blood vessels and fibrocollagenous tissue with chronic inflammatory infiltrate. Cytocentrifuged smears from fluid showed lymphocytes, and no malignant or atypical cells were seen.

Outcomes:
The surgical exploration led to a complete excision of the entire lesion.

The patient, a 67-year-old Caucasian female with a history of polycystic liver disease and portal hypertension, presented to the hospital with a one-day history of hematemesis and melena. She had a previous diagnosis of esophageal varices, which had been successfully banded during an esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) one year prior. Upon admission, the patient complained of epigastric pain and had two episodes of bright red emesis and four episodes of dark colored stools, followed by a brief syncopal episode lasting for 10-15 seconds. 

Physical examination revealed the patient to be afebrile but tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypotensive. Cardiopulmonary examination was normal, and abdominal examination showed mild distension with epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness. Initial laboratory work showed low hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet counts, along with nonanion gap metabolic acidosis and elevated total bilirubin level. 

The patient was resuscitated with fluids, pressors, and PRBC transfusion and was electively intubated due to hemodynamic instability and altered mental status. An EGD was performed, revealing varices with stigmata of high risk for bleeding. The procedure was successful, with bands applied starting from cardia up to midesophagus. A CT scan of the abdomen showed an enlarged spleen, ascites, and multiple cysts in the liver, consistent with portal hypertension. The patient was closely monitored, and pressors were weaned off. She did not have any further episodes of hematemesis but continued to have melena and required additional PRBC transfusions. 

Repeat EGDs were performed showing additional esophageal varices with intact bands from the previous procedure. The patient successfully underwent additional banding, and her hemoglobin remained stable for the rest of her hospital stay. 

During her hospital stay, the patient underwent therapeutic paracentesis with normal peritoneal fluid analysis (except for serum ascites albumin gradient greater than 1.1 g/dl) and was prescribed propranolol, furosemide, and spironolactone for management of portal hypertension.

Hospital Course:

The 7-year old male patient from Miandoab, Iran was admitted to the Shahid Abbasi teaching Hospital with febrile serial generalized tonic-clonic seizures. He was stabilized using bolus doses of phenobarbital and phenytoin, but his consciousness level decreased, necessitating endotracheal intubation and assisted ventilation. He was then transferred to Urmia’s Motahari Hospital. 

Upon evaluation, the patient was suffering from a deep coma, but his vital signs were normal. His pupils were dilated with inadequate response to light, the liver was palpable about 4cm below the costal margin; his muscular tone severely diminished, and deep tendon reflexes were undetectable. Routine laboratory tests revealed nonketotic hypoglycemia and elevated liver enzymes. 

Further investigations were conducted to ascertain the cause of hypoglycemia. The endocrinology consultation ruled out lipid malabsorption, respiratory chain disorder, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes and hyperinsulinemia. Laboratory tests suggested by our pediatric gastroenterologist to detect the viral or immune cause of hepatitis revealed nothing, and the urine toxicology screening test was negative. 

Further investigation was conducted to rule out inherited inborn errors of metabolism. Dried blood spot samples were sent to a lab in Germany for tandem mass spectrometry, which revealed elevated levels of medium-chain acylcarnitines, consistent with medium-chain acyl-coA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD). 

The patient's older male sibling had also passed away five years ago due to similar symptoms, which further strengthened the possibility of MCADD. Unfortunately, the patient died two days after admission due to multiple organ system failures. Molecular genetics verification was impossible due to the patient's death.

Discharge Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with MCADD, a rare but potentially life-threatening metabolic disorder. This condition is characterized by a deficiency in the enzyme responsible for breaking down medium-chain fatty acids for energy production. The condition can lead to a decreased production of glucose, leading to hypoglycemia and subsequent multiple organ system failures.

Discharge Instructions:

Given the sudden and tragic nature of the patient's passing, there was no opportunity to provide discharge instructions. 

Follow-up Care:

There is no requirement for follow-up care as the patient passed away.

Diagnosis: TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma and central hyperthyroidism

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 55-year-old man, was admitted to the hospital after being transferred from a local hospital due to incidentally discovered AF. After receiving radiofrequency ablation for his AF, the patient was found to have hormonal imbalances indicating thyrotoxicosis, a positive result for TSH receptor antibody, and a thyroid gland that was diffusely enlarged with a nodule located in the left lobe. Fine needle aspiration biopsy suggested that the nodule was benign. Upon further examination, an MRI of the sella region revealed a pituitary tumor measuring 2.3 × 1.7 × 2.2 cm3 in the sella, involving the cavernous sinuses and extending into the suprasellar cistern. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with TSH-producing pituitary macroadenoma and central hyperthyroidism.

One week after diagnosis, the patient underwent transsphenoidal neurosurgery to remove the pituitary macroadenoma. The resected pituitary adenoma cells were found to be positive for TSH and PRL antibodies, with the percentage of positive Ki-67 being less than 2%, indicating that the tumor was benign. After surgery, the patient's TSH levels and thyroid hormone levels returned to within the normal ranges.

One year after surgery, the patient's thyroid hormone levels increased beyond the normal ranges, although no residual tumor was found on MRI. Additionally, positive results were obtained for TRAb, and both TgAb and TPOAb were elevated beyond their normal ranges. The patient was prescribed thyrozol 10 mg/day, which was effective in keeping thyroid function tests within normal ranges during 3 years of follow-up.

During the patient's hospital course, there were no significant complications. The patient was discharged with instructions to continue taking thyrozol 10 mg/day and to follow up with an endocrinologist for further evaluation and treatment.

Disposition:

The patient was discharged to home in stable condition with instructions to follow up with an endocrinologist. The patient was prescribed thyrozol 10 mg/day, and instructed to continue taking the medication as prescribed.

Admitting Diagnosis: Generalized abdominal pain postcolonoscopy


Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the general surgical on-call with a four-day history of generalized abdominal pain postcolonoscopy. He also reported nausea and slightly reduced stoma output. The patient's past medical history included asthma and Crohn's disease which had settled at the time leading up to the colonoscopy. Further investigation revealed a large mass overlying the hernia to the left of the midline with a tender and slightly tender area, and a cough impulse in the abdomen. The computed tomography scan showed significant amounts of free gas, most likely secondary to a recent colonoscopy that had probably blown off the ascending colon stump.

The patient was managed with an ABCDE approach, and intravenous fluids, analgesia, and monitoring of output were commenced. A conservative approach was adopted, and the patient was discharged just days following admission. He did very well, and is currently undergoing review at one of our quaternary centers for his abdominal wall reconstruction.

Follow-up was made with the quaternary center, and they reported that the colonoscopy had gone to plan and was performed meticulously and that there was no evidence of perforation. It was noted that there was evidence of inflammation macroscopically and microscopically, and this was determined to be nonspecific.

Instructions:

The patient was instructed to follow up with the quaternary center for abdominal wall reconstruction review. The patient was given instructions to follow up with his primary care physician in two weeks and to monitor for worsening of symptoms, such as abdominal pain or discomfort, fever, or changes in bowel movement patterns. The patient was also advised to avoid strenuous activity, heavy lifting, and to maintain a healthy diet.

Conclusion:

The patient has been discharged in stable condition, with a conservative approach to management. Follow-up has been scheduled with the quaternary center for abdominal wall reconstruction review and the patient has received further instructions on monitoring symptoms and follow-up with their primary care physician.",,,0

The 23-year-old woman presented with progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for 1 week. Imaging revealed an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic change located at the left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift. The patient underwent an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in December 2006. 

Diagnosis:
The pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis. These findings confirmed the diagnosis of classic GBM.

Treatment:
The patient underwent radiotherapy 1 month later and followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for 6 months. She showed improvement in performance status and clinical condition; however, follow-up imaging in June and October 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion that required surgical removal.

Post-op Findings:
The pathology report showed features of the oligodendroglial component. The neoplastic cells expressed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), p53, and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) as revealed by immunostaining. During her follow-ups, signs of increased intracranial pressure were noted in May 2015, leading to the third debulking surgery. The third pathology revealed both GBM- and PNET-like components, with the PNET-like component exhibiting positivity for synaptophysin and CD56 and focal weak positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Reason for Hospitalization:
The patient was admitted due to a five-day clinical picture consisting of additive, symmetrical polyarticular pain, located in the wrists, knees, and left shoulder without other associated symptoms.

Hospital Course:
During the hospitalization, the patient underwent magnetic resonance imaging of the different compromised anatomical compartments. The imaging revealed bilateral carpal synovitis, left suprapatellar synovitis, and synovitis of the sternoclavicular joints along with bursitis of the lateral collateral ligament of the left lower limb and a peritendinous inflammatory process of the triangular fibrocartilage in the right wrist. Laboratory studies showed marked elevation of acute-phase reactants. Differential diagnoses of infectious etiology were sought, including a positive fourth-generation HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with a subsequent CD4 count of 98 cells/mm3 and a viral load of 459,000 copies/mL. Treatment with prednisolone at a dose of 1 mg/kg and sulfasalazine (1 g per day) was initiated, and sequential changes from disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) were made, such as methotrexate and leflunomide, but no significant improvement in joint symptoms was noted. Subsequently, the patient achieved a complete joint response when antiretroviral therapy (abacavir, dolutegravir/lamivudine) was initiated, thereby achieving a response to therapy resulting in gradual reduction of glucocorticoid doses and tapering to maintenance therapy solely with sulfasalazine.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with symmetrical polyarticular pain, synovitis of joints, bursitis, and peritendinous inflammatory process.

Condition at Discharge:
At the time of discharge, the patient's condition was stable, showing a complete joint response.

Follow-up Care:

The patient was admitted with complaints of fever, headache, and vomiting. Imaging studies of the brain and thorax revealed ring-enhancing lesions in the brain and a 6.5 cm x 4.5 cm lung mass suggestive of malignancy. Lumbar puncture showed raised intracranial pressure with the detection of Cryptococcus gattii in the cerebrospinal fluid. Bronchoalveolar lavage confirmed the presence of Cryptococcus yeasts in the lung. Induction therapy with amphotericin B and flucytosine followed by maintenance therapy with fluconazole was initiated, and therapeutic lumbar punctures were performed to manage intracranial pressure. Brain imaging showed complete resolution of cerebral cryptococcomas, and CT chest showed a reduction in the size of consolidation. However, at 15 months, new ground-glass opacities were seen in all lobes, with focal areas of crazy-paving pattern seen in bilateral upper lobes. Flexible bronchoscopy did not reveal any new opportunistic infections, and lung biopsy showed intra-alveolar accumulation of foamy macrophages and airspaces containing PAS-positive amorphous eosinophilic material, which was consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP).

Hospital Course	

The patient presented at the clinic with complaints of numbness in the soles of both feet. On lumbar MRI, severe L4-5 central stenosis and root redundancy were diagnosed. On February 28, 2018, L4-5 OLIF, followed by bilateral L4 laminotomy and L4-5 percutaneous posterior screw fixation (PPSF) was performed. 

Postoperatively, there was an increase in the disc height and foramen height. Two days later, the patient was allowed to walk while wearing an orthosis, and the radiating pain improved; he was then discharged from the hospital. At 6 weeks after surgery, lumbar CT and radiographic examination showed that the fusion was maintained without subsidence of the surgical site.

In the 10th week after surgery, the patient visited the outpatient clinic with a cane, complaining of persistent pain below both ankles and motor weakness of the right ankle. A decrease in dorsiflexion of the right ankle was observed. The Medical Research Council (MRC) muscle strength grade of the right ankle was 2. We confirmed the resolution of the previous central stenosis and root redundancy on lumbar MRI and found no other specific findings.

On May 21, 2018, the patient underwent right L4/5 facetectomy and foraminotomy to release the right L4 nerve root. During surgery, the tissues compressing the L4 nerve root and the osteophyte protruding severely and trapping the nerve root were identified and removed. Within 1 week of hospitalization after surgery, the radiating pain in both feet disappeared, and dorsiflexion of the right ankle was restored to MRC grade 4. After the second surgery, follow-up CT of the lumbar spine confirmed clear decompression of the right foramen.

Impression	

This is a case of a 78-year-old male with severe L4-5 central stenosis and root redundancy, who underwent L4-5 OLIF, bilateral L4 laminotomy, and L4-5 PPSF. The patient presented with persistent pain below both ankles and motor weakness of the right ankle 10 weeks after the procedure, which prompted a second surgery with right L4/5 facetectomy and foraminotomy. The symptoms resolved after the second surgery. 

Plan	

Continue to monitor the patient after the second surgery and provide supportive care as needed. Follow up with the patient to assess the long-term effectiveness of the procedure to release the right L4 nerve root. Provide further targeted treatment if necessary. Educate the patient about the surgery and the importance of taking measures to prevent further spinal cord injury.",,,0

998,"Hospital Course Summary:

This is a summary of the hospital course for a 42-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department with acute onset right flank pain. The patient had a history of endometriosis and was found to have a right perinephric hemorrhage and an exophytic hypervascular mass arising from the lower pole of the right kidney with a maximum diameter of 5.5 cm, as well as multiple thin-walled cysts in the lung bases. The patient was diagnosed with lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and treated conservatively for the retroperitoneal hemorrhage. 

The patient underwent a follow-up CT abdomen two months later, which showed complete disappearance of the perirenal blood and an unchanged renal tumor in volume and imaging characteristics. Despite the inability to rule out a hypernephroma based on the CT characteristics, the patient underwent a right partial nephrectomy due to the risk of rehemorrhage and the possibility of the lesion being a benign angiomyolipoma. Pathology confirmed the presence of an angiomyolipoma. The patient was transferred to an academic center with expertise in interstitial lung diseases and lung transplantation for further follow-up.

Summary of Follow-Up Care:

The patient was discharged to the care of her primary care physician with detailed instructions for follow-up care. She was advised to continue her medical treatment plan and attend all scheduled appointments with specialists. The patient was educated on the importance of regular monitoring for both her endometriosis and LAM. She was instructed to report any new symptoms or concerns to her primary care physician as soon as possible. 

The patient's prognosis is guarded due to the presence of LAM and history of endometriosis. Close monitoring and multidisciplinary care by specialists are recommended.

Patient Name: [name]                 Medical Record Number: [number] 

Diagnosis: 

The patient was admitted with severe dyspnea at rest, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrhythmias, as well as a history of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. His coronary angiography and left ventricular endomyocardial biopsy tests were negative for coronary artery disease and myocarditis, respectively. The patient also had a mitral valve repair with annuloplasty and percutaneous patent foramen ovale (PFO) closure. 

Hospital Course: 

Upon admission, the patient was treated with optimal medical treatment (valsartan 80 mg twice daily, torasemid 5 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 2.5 mg twice daily, eplerenon 25 mg once daily), and a CardioMEMS system was implanted in June 2017. During CardioMEMS implantation, a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure of 14 mmHg and a cardiac index of 2.4 l/min were measured. However, the patient experienced another decompensation event soon after hospital discharge. Further hospital admissions resulted in recurrent hospitalizations to manage the patient's severe decompensation events.

Treatment: 

In November 2017, the patient was switched from optimal medical treatment to ARNI Sacubitril-Valsartan 49/51 mg twice daily. Following the introduction of ARNI, the patient's subjective condition, his ejection fraction (LV EF increased from 29 to 39%, LV ESV from 146 to 133 ml, LVEDV from 205 to 219 ml from July to November), and his hemodynamics showed a consistent improvement. NT-pro BNP also decreased from 76,733 ng/l in July 2017 to 1533ng/l in November 2017.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for a non-painful, mobile mass of the right inguinal fold that had been evolving over a period of 7 months. The patient's medical history included childhood asthma, chronic tonsillitis, seven pregnancies, four children, caesarean section, and abortions. Pelvic ultrasound showed a suspicious non-circumscribed mass measuring 5 cm in its longer axis. CT scan confirmed the presence of this inguinal mass, measuring 5.8 × 4.9 × 3.2 cm and extending within the right femoral triangle in contact with the long adductor muscle, without enhanced contrast, and without locoregional lymph node. Histologically, the patient was diagnosed with a granular cell tumor (Abrikossoff's tumor) without any malignant signs. Tumorectomy of this inguinal mass was performed three weeks later.

At the gross pathology examination, the tumoral tissue was homogeneous with a greyish stain. The margin was not well defined, and the hypodermic, dermic were involved. One lymph node was discovered and was invaded. Due to microscopic resection and the nodal status, it was decided at the oncology committee to perform a large surgical revision with an inguinal curage. Pathological evaluation did not reveal tumor tissue in the tumorectomy region but showed metastatic invasion by granular cells in four of twelve lymph nodes, without capsular rupture. Adjuvant chemotherapy was excluded because of very low mitotic activity. To reduce the risk of local recurrence, adjuvant radiotherapy on the tumor bed and right inguinal area of ​​50 Gy in conventional fractionation was delivered. After 10 months after the end of radiotherapy, the patient is in complete remission.

Follow-Up Plan:
Due to the unpredictable tumor, the follow-up strategy is a physical examination with a CT scan every 4 months for the first 2 post-operative years, then every 6 months for up 5 years and yearly thereafter, as a sarcoma. 

Diagnosis:
Granular cell tumor (Abrikossoff's tumor)

Recommendations:
The patient should continue to receive regular physical examinations and CT scans as outlined in the follow-up plan. Any concerning symptoms or changes should be immediately reported to the patient's healthcare provider.

Diagnosis: Joint Infection, B. vietnamiensis

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 67-year-old male with a medical history significant for gout, hypertension, and osteoarthritis, was admitted to the hospital after a fall resulting in acute worsening of pain in his right knee. On examination, the patient was found to have a swollen right knee and a significantly increased serum creatinine. Laboratory testing also revealed leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance as well as elevated C-reactive protein. Urine dipstick showed positive blood, leukocyte esterase, and nitrite. Urine culture identified B. vietnamiensis, a B. cepacia complex organism.

During his hospitalization, the patient's right knee became increasingly swollen and painful. Treatment for gout was ineffective, and a joint aspiration was performed, which revealed purulent fluid and intracellular calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Culture grew B. vietnamiensis. Susceptibility testing indicated minimum inhibitory concentration values in the susceptible range for meropenem, levofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ceftazidime, and minocycline. Irrigation and debridement of the knee joint was performed, and the patient received three days of empiric meropenem followed by six weeks of ceftazidime therapy.

The patient's knee pain improved significantly, and he left the hospital against medical advice after completing twenty-eight days of antibiotic therapy. By the time of discharge, the patient's leukocyte and C-reactive protein levels had normalized.

Recommendations:

1. Follow up with primary care physician for regular monitoring and management of gout, hypertension, and osteoarthritis.

2. Continue with antibiotic therapy as directed.

3. Follow up with orthopedics for further evaluation and management of the joint infection.

4. Contact the healthcare provider immediately if symptoms worsen or new symptoms arise.

5. Maintain a healthy lifestyle with regular exercise, a balanced diet, and stress reduction techniques.

Patient: Male, 66 years old
Date of Admission: April 2017
Date of Discharge: May 2017

Medical History:
Arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, coronary artery disease, and tobacco smoking. The patient had a history of clinical tuberculosis in childhood. He underwent local resection and weekly intravesical instillation of BCG (BCG-MEDAC) in 2015 to treat bladder cancer.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a 7 kg weight loss and nocturnal low-grade fever. A thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computerized tomography scan revealed pulmonary embolism, a sub-renal septic aneurysm, and a collection in the right psoas muscle. 18FDG PET/CT scan showed intense hypermetabolism of the aortic aneurysm. During physical examination, the patient complained of dyspnea and diffuse abdominal pain. Hemoglobin concentration was found to be low at 10.8 g/dL, while lymphocytes were 0.7 G/L and C-reactive protein was 60 mg/L. Surgery revealed a rupture on the right flank of the aorta, which explained the psoas hematoma. Routine bacteriological investigations remained negative, but pathological examination showed chronic granulomatous inflammation of the vascular wall, leading to a differential diagnosis of BCG aneurysm. Combining rpoBMTC-FISH and Ziehl-Neelsen-staining allowed for specific detection of mycobacteria. Tazocillin was discontinued, and an anti-tuberculous treatment, which included ethambutol and a combination of isoniazid and rifampicin, was continued for two months. The treatment was then relayed by an oral combination of rifampicin and isoniazid for eight months. A follow-up CT scan showed the absence of relapse of the aortic collection, and a 9-month clinical follow-up indicated a favorable clinical and biological evolution. 

Hospital course was complicated due to existing medical conditions and previous cancer treatment. However, proper diagnosis and early intervention led to a successful treatment outcome. The patient was discharged from the hospital in May 2017.",,,0

1905,"Hospital Course:
The patient, a 21-year-old male, presented with increased appetite, heat intolerance, sweating and fatigue. Examination revealed a sinus rhythm with heart rate of 96/min, and mild exophthalmos with lid lag and fine tremor in the hands. The thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was suppressed at 0.02 m IU/ml (normal range: 0.04-4.50), while free thyroxine (free T4) was elevated at 2 ng/ml (normal range: 0.8-1.8). The patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism due to the severity of the symptoms. Further anti-TG and anti-TPO tests revealed elevated levels of 517 IU/ml (<20 IU) and > 1,000 IU/ml (<35 IU/ml), respectively, with mildly elevated thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI): 164.9 (<125). Although the elevated TSI indicated Graves' disease, the normal radioiodine uptake scan (9.6; normal range: 9.5%-30%) led to a decision to manage the condition medically. The patient was treated with methimazole and atenolol. After 16 months, the TSH levels normalized, and the patient was weaned off methimazole. During a subsequent follow-up visit, however, the TSH level increased to 4.15 mIU/ml, suggesting subclinical hypothyroidism. Hashimoto's thyroiditis was diagnosed, and the patient was started on levothyroxine replacement therapy. The patient had since remained euthyroid on levothyroxine therapy and was advised to follow up routinely.

Discussion:
The patient presented with clinical features suggestive of hyperthyroidism and biochemical tests indicated the presence of Graves' disease. However, the normal radioiodine uptake scan made it feasible to manage the condition with medical therapy rather than radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. The subsequent drop in thyroid hormone secretion possibly led to the development of autoimmune hypothyroidism in the form of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

Overall Impression:
The patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism due to Graves' disease and managed with medical therapy. Over time, his TSH level normalized, but there was evidence of autoimmune hypothyroidism with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. The patient was started on levothyroxine therapy and advised to follow up regularly.",,,0

History of Present Illness:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with locally advanced papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) that had invaded the trachea, esophagus, and left recurrent nerve. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral modified radical neck dissection, followed by a window resection of the trachea. The patient was then diagnosed with PTC, pT4aN1bM0, stage IVA. A one-stage reconstruction was performed using an auricular deltopectoral flap. 

Hospital Course:
The operation was successful, but a final histopathological estimation of the tracheal margin was positive. Three months after the operation, a recurrent tumor was detected outside the left piriform fossa and was given 100 mCi of I-131 therapy. Nine months after the operation, the patient experienced apparent dyspnea and a dull pain in the right shoulder. A CT scan revealed prominent tumor progression in both the neck and the lung, and bone scintigraphy showed bone metastasis in the right scapula. The patient underwent EBRT for the recurrent neck tumor (60 Gy) and the right scapula (36 Gy), and docetaxel was administered once per 3 weeks for 24 months. The lung metastasis was exceptionally enlarged, but the docetaxel was temporarily very effective for the local recurrence. Three years after the operation, the patient was started with the newly emerged TKI sorafenib. However, because of the exacerbation of lung metastasis, it was terminated in 9 months. Therefore, 45 months after the operation, lenvatinib was started, which showed remarkable improvement for the tumor and lung metastasis.

A 40-year-old Asian woman was incidentally found to have a small nodule in the lower lobe of her right lung during a regular medical checkup. A CT scan revealed a lytic lesion of the fifth lumbar vertebral bone as well. Biopsy specimens from both lesions were histologically similar, which showed spindle cell neoplasms with a bland appearance. The patient was closely monitored with suspicion of multiple metastases from an unknown primary tumor. 

Five years later, the pulmonary nodule and the lytic lesion in the fifth lumbar vertebra showed an increase in size. Therefore, the patient underwent video-assisted thoracic surgery and curettage of the lytic bone lesion for further evaluation. The tumor of the fifth left transverse process was exposed on the posterior surface but not on the anterior surface. During the clinical course, no significant findings other than the pulmonary and vertebral lesions were found, even with imaging examinations. The patient made good postoperative progress and remained free of disease at 41 months after the operation.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with rapidly progressive gait disturbance, lower extremity weakness, and ascending hypoesthesia. The nerve conduction studies showed a proximal demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy with active denervation, prolonged motor distal latency, and a reduction in the motor conduction velocity in N. medianus and N. ulnaris. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed albuminocytologic dissociation with an elevated protein level. The patient was diagnosed with typical CIDP (chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy) and treated with IVIg therapy with significant improvement.

During follow-up, the patient complained of increasing physical exhaustion, reduction in walking distance, and worsening of residual dysphagia. The patient was found to have MG (Myasthenia gravis) due to the positive AChR (Acetylcholine receptor) antibodies, titin antibodies, and abnormal decrement seen on repetitive nerve stimulation. The patient received pyridostigmine and had the anterior mediastinal mass confirmed to be a thymoma.

The patient was maintained on long-term immunosuppression with azathioprine and prednisone in addition to IVIg therapy, which improved dysphagia, dysarthria, and gait unsteadiness. The patient was later diagnosed with anti-phospholipase A2 receptor antibody-positive membranous glomerulonephritis, a common cause of nephrotic syndrome, and was treated appropriately.

Admitting Diagnosis: Increasing pain in left hip joint

Hospital Course:

Upon admission on [REDACTED], the patient complained of pain in her left hip joint. A skin burst with crusting, and redness was observed in the anteromedial region of the left knee. Cultured aspirate from the left hip joint cavity revealed the presence of “S. aureus” (strain XNO62). Although surgical debridement was proposed, it was declined by the patient. Therefore, periodic dressing changes for the knee, irrigation with amikacin, injection with vancomycin for the hip joint, and systemic applications of amikacin and vancomycin were performed. The patient was discharged on day 7 after clinical symptoms improved and infection indicators declined.

On day 89, the patient was readmitted with pain and swelling in her left hip. Radical debridement of the hip joint was performed, and another “S. aureus” strain (strain XNO106) was isolated from the periarticular tissue in the left hip during the operation. The patient was discharged on day 115 after clinical symptoms improved and infection indicators declined, but she continues to have frequent relapses of pain and infection of the hip afterward.

Laboratory data showed that the values of WBC count, Neu%, CRP, and ESR were all high in the initial infection caused by strain XNO62. In the second hospitalization, the WBC, Neu%, and CRP values were relatively lower (increased WBC and Neu% values at day 100 might be caused by the operation), but the ESR value remained high throughout the course of the infection. No hematological disorder was identified that may cause high ESR value.

Admitting Diagnosis: Asymptomatic Gross Hematuria

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of asymptomatic gross hematuria. On cystoscopy, a gross hematuria was observed from the right ureteral orifice. Noncontrast enhanced CT revealed a right renal stone and a complicated cyst in the upper pole of her right kidney, which was categorized as a Bosniak type IIF cyst on dynamic CT, with a maximum diameter of 58 mm. The renal stone was removed using flexible ureteroscopic lithotripsy. 

As a calyceal diverticulum was diagnosed preoperatively as a complicated cyst, we proceeded with endoscopy combined with intrarenal surgery (ECIRS) to remove the contents completely, without follow-up observation. Pathological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the calyceal diverticulum, with the upper urinary tract stone composed of unspecified protein.

A right radical nephroureterectomy was performed using a laparoscopic approach, with curative intent. Pathological analysis confirmed a high-grade squamous cell carcinoma with renal parenchymal invasion (pT3). Local recurrence was confirmed by CT imaging performed 2 months after the surgery.

The patient was treated with adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, using cisplatin and gemcitabine, but went into septic shock during the first course of chemotherapy, requiring cessation of systemic therapy, with her general condition worsening thereafter. The patient opted for palliative care only and passed away 4 months after the radical nephroureterectomy was performed.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

This 59-year-old female presented with dyspnea and an oxygen saturation level of 65%, leading to an immediate tracheal intubation due to moderate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with reduced lung compliance. After being diagnosed, the patient was treated with deep sedation, neuromuscular blocking agents, and prone positioning. On day 14, a trial of sitting on the edge-of-bed (SOEB) was performed, resulting in a significant increase in the patient's level of consciousness and collaborative state. The patient's muscle strength indicated ICU-acquired weakness, with a Medical Research Council sum-score (MRC-SS) of 40/60. Despite the weakness, she was continuously encouraged to mobilize herself with exercises against gravity, and she was actively transferred to a chair each day. After successful extubation, she presented postextubation dysphagia, which was closely monitored for secretion management and cough stimulation. Physical rehabilitation was continued, and the patient started walking with a walking aid on day 19. Her oxygen desaturation during exercise training became evident at this point, and after 25 days, she was transferred to the institution's rehabilitation facilities where she received further treatment.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 74-year-old male, ASA physical class III, with a history of hypertension and previous cystolitholapaxy for bilateral ureteral stones, was admitted for tumor-wide excision, mandibulotomy, tracheostomy, and free flap reconstruction because of mouth floor squamous cell carcinoma. The patient presented with a mild productive cough and was being treated with losartan and hydrochlorothiazide. The patient underwent general anesthesia without any complications. Following a standard monitoring setup, mechanical ventilation was implemented, and the patient was induced with remifentanil, lidocaine, propofol, and succinylcholine. A cuffed 8.0 sized tracheostomy tube was placed, and the patient underwent an uneventful tracheostomy without any complications. Despite the recruitment maneuver, the patient's SpO2 continued to drop down from 96% to 89%, and physical examinations revealed that chest wall movement was normal at the left side but significantly suppressed at the right side. The patient was evaluated with a bedside lung POCUS, which indicated decreasing lung sliding over the right upper lung field and a reduced sandy seashore sign. Right mainstem intubation by the tracheostomy tube was excluded by fiberoptic bronchoscopy exam. However, copious sticky yellowish sputum was encountered in the bronchial branches, especially at the right upper bronchus. Portable chest radiography was taken, which showed partial atelectasis over the right upper lobe and increased interstitial lung density, which was compatible with the ultrasound findings. After adequate suctioning and recruitment maneuvers, an ABG analysis was repeated, which revealed a low PaO2. Due to suspected pneumonia, the surgery was deferred, and empirical antimicrobial treatment with piperacillin and tazobactam was initiated. Haemophilus influenza was isolated from the sputum culture. After a 10-day antibiotic treatment course, a repeat chest radiograph was clear, and the patient received the pre-planned surgery uneventfully.

History of Present Illness:
The patient, a 26-year-old woman, presented at AG Dental Care Clinic in October 2015 with a chief complaint of spontaneous gingival bleeding and discomfort in the anterior and posterior gingival region of the right maxilla. She reported feeling less confident due to the appearance of slightly larger than normal gingiva. The patient sought gingivectomy treatment and experienced successful results in terms of function, aesthetics, and biology of the gingival region. However, in the following years, the patient returned with the same complaint, which was resolved through a combination of gingivectomy and scaling and root planing treatment.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent gingivectomy treatment, which resolved her chief complaint of spontaneous gingival bleeding and discomfort. She reported feeling comfortable and confident with the appearance of her gingiva. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) was collected, and RT-PCR was performed to examine TGF-β1 gene expression, while ELISA was performed to examine TGF-β1 protein level. Smear plaque was also collected from the tooth surface, and bacterial culture examination was conducted to identify bacterial species based on bacterial morphology before and after gingivectomy treatment. Biopsy of excised gingival tissue was performed to determine tissue morphology and tumour subtype, grading of gingival cells.

Results:
The results of the patient's treatments were successful, with the patient no longer presenting with spontaneous gingival bleeding or discomfort. Additionally, there was an improvement in the aesthetics and function of the gingival region. RT-PCR and ELISA examinations revealed TGF-β1 gene expression and protein level. Bacterial culture examination was conducted, and bacterial species were identified based on the bacterial morphology before and after gingivectomy treatment. Gingival tissue biopsy revealed tissue morphology and tumour subtype, grading of gingival cells.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) with Ann Arbor Stage IIIA and developed complications of Haemorrhagic Cystitis (HC) associated with BKV and ADV viral infection after relapsing from chemotherapy. She underwent auto-PBSCT and later had BK Viraemia with complications and BKV pneumonia.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital in 2017 for auto-PBSCT after salvage chemotherapy. On the day of transplantation, she developed grade 3 haematuria, and we diagnosed her with haemorrhagic cystitis (HC) associated with BKV and ADV viral infection. Although the patient received immunoglobulin and adenine arabinoside, the HC symptoms did not improve. The patient's ADV DNA load became negative, but the BKV DNA load in urine did not decrease. The patient also developed respiratory failure and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels. Chest CT showed ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the bilateral upper lobe, and we performed BAL. In BAL, although BALF was not macroscopically reddish, BAL slightly detected red blood cells on cytology. Although we could not perform lung biopsy because of low blood platelet count, we diagnosed the patient with BKV pneumonia. After re-administering cidofovir, respiratory symptoms and GGO in CT abated, although HC symptoms persisted.

Discharge Summary:
The patient's DLBCL and complications of HC, BK viraemia with complications and BKV pneumonia were treated during this hospital stay.

This is a comprehensive summary of the hospital course of a 71-year-old male patient who presented with slowly enlarging bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, parotid swelling, and night sweats in 2015. The patient's medical history was significant for melanoma removed in 2015 and active smoking for over 40 years. During the patient’s initial workup, multiple enlarged bilateral parotid lesions, scattered enlarged level I and II nodes, and upper mediastinal lymph nodes were detected.

Diagnostic and Therapeutic interventions:

The patient underwent ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration, core needle biopsy, and level IA neck dissection. Pathology revealed Warthin Tumor and no evidence of malignancy or lymphoma. After a six-month follow-up, stable appearance of the bilateral parotid masses and cervical lymph nodes were noted, but there was interval enlargement of right upper mediastinal paratracheal lymph nodes. The patient was referred to the Department of Otolaryngology where physical examination revealed bilateral enlarged parotid glands and bulky cervical lymphadenopathy slightly larger on the right. He underwent level II lymph node dissection with the removal of a large nodal conglomerate, and histopathology once again confirmed Warthin tumor.

Summary:

The patient presented with cervical lymphadenopathy and parotid swelling. Diagnostic workup revealed a Warthin tumor without evidence of malignancy or lymphoma. The patient underwent level IA and II lymph node dissection with removal of a large nodal conglomerate, and histopathology once again confirmed Warthin tumor.

Hospital Course:

Admission: The patient, a 79-year-old male, with a history of pancreatic pseudocyst secondary to idiopathic acute pancreatitis diagnosed two years ago, was admitted with severe acute gastrointestinal bleed presenting with melena and a hemoglobin level of 5.8 g/dL. The patient was admitted to the ICU for supportive care including pantoprazole infusion, blood transfusion, and close monitoring.

Assessment: CT scan of the abdomen revealed a complex pancreatic mass representing a bleeding pancreatic pseudocyst, which had increased in size when compared with the previous CT scans. EGD/EUS showed submucosal bulging likely from extrinsic compression on the proximal gastric body and fundus with a small clean-based ulcer on the top of this bulge. EUS confirmed the presence of anechoic lesion with hyperechoic shadowing suggestive of cyst/pseudocyst with bleeding located in the tail of the pancreas. The patient continued to have melena and a decrease in hemoglobin to 6.3 g/dL for which an additional two units of PRBCs were provided.

Intervention: Interventional Radiology was requested to perform a mesenteric angiogram with hope that it may help identify and control the source of bleeding; however, angiogram did not demonstrate any active bleeding vessel. Ultimately, the bleeding stopped spontaneously. The patient had another EGD/EUS which again noted two openings over the greater curvature of the stomach suggestive of fistulous communication of the lesion with the stomach lumen. A bullet-tipped catheter was inserted into the lumen, and aspiration showed blood consistent with hemorrhagic pancreatic pseudocyst fistulizing into the stomach and causing severe upper gastrointestinal bleed.

Follow-up: Follow-up CT abdomen one year later revealed calcification in the head and uncinate process of pancreas along with scarring in the uncinate process, consistent with chronic pancreatitis. Additionally, the pseudocyst that was abutting the stomach wall had resolved.

Diagnosis: Pancreatic pseudocyst with bleeding and fistulous communication with the stomach.

Condition at Discharge: Stable.

Discharge Instructions: The patient is advised to follow up with a gastroenterologist and continue management of chronic pancreatitis. The patient is also instructed to monitor for any signs of gastrointestinal bleeding, such as melena, hematemesis, or general fatigue.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient, a 65-year-old white male, presented to the clinic with a central scotoma in his left eye for 10 days. The visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/32 in the left eye at the time of admission. The fundus examination of the affected (left) eye revealed an area of the retinal pigment epithelium atrophy in the inferonasal macula with foveal sparing. Fundus autofluorescence showed a trizonal pattern, and a hyper-fluorescent line was evident between the involved and uninvolved portions of the retina, which was consistent with acute zonal occult outer retinopathy.

Ten days later, the patient reported distortion, and the examination revealed an expansion of zonal lesion, which was confirmed by fundus autofluorescence. Optical coherence tomography showed mild subretinal fluid in the affected eye, which explained the metamorphopsia. A week later, the patient's visual acuity had reduced to 20/60, and two perilesional hemorrhages were noted. Additionally, hypo-autofluorescent zonal expansion included the fovea. These findings suggested the presence of Type 2 choroidal neovascularization. This diagnosis was further confirmed by fluorescein angiography.

The patient received 3 monthly intravitreal injections of bevacizumab, which led to zonal progression and worsening of the subretinal fluid. One month after the third injection, the visual acuity of the affected eye was 20/70, and the patient reported stabilization of the central scotoma. At the fifth month, the patient's visual acuity was 20/60, and the OCT showed the resolution of SRF, while FAF revealed minimal advancement of zonal lesion size. During the follow-up, the zonal lesions stabilized, and the patient received 11 intravitreal bevacizumab injections on a treat and extend regimen for four years and maintained a visual acuity of 20/60 in the affected eye.

In conclusion, the patient's discharge summary reveals a diagnosis of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy with Type 2 choroidal neovascularization, leading to a central scotoma in the left eye. The treatment of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab has been successful in stabilizing the zonal lesions and maintaining the patient's visual acuity of 20/60 during the follow-up period of four years. The patient has been advised for regular follow-up with necessary ophthalmological evaluations.",,,0

The patient, a 29-year-old male, presented with progressively worsening symptoms, including altered mental status, lower extremity weakness, nausea, and vomiting for 6 months. The symptomatology extended back more than 6 years prior to this decline. He also reported headaches, dizziness, multiple falls, and right facial numbness.

The initial pre- and post-contrast-enhanced CT scans demonstrated diffuse enhancement of the basimeninges as well as heterogeneously enhancing cystic and solid lesions in the right temporal lobe and left cerebellum.

Initial laboratory findings were significant only for an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Subsequent biopsies of the right temporal lobe and dura were negative for neoplasm or any other abnormality. In addition, analyses of aspirated cyst contents were negative for inflammation or malignancy.

A presumptive diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis was made, and the patient was started on prednisone. He had symptomatic improvement with the prednisone and was discharged following recovery from the biopsy.

Follow-up MRI 11 months later demonstrated progression of his disease with an interval increase in size of the intracranial lesions. A repeat ultrasound-guided brain biopsy showed an astrocytoma with protoplasmic features.

Craniospinal radiation therapy was recommended instead of radical surgical resection. After multiple cycles of radiation therapy, the studies showed a slight interval increase in size of the brain lesions but decrease in nodular enhancement of the spinal meninges.

Following treatment, the patient continued to take dexamethasone for symptomatic relief. His disease progressed and did not respond to further medical or surgical management, and he ultimately passed away.

A 54-year-old male patient with a 30-year history of tobacco use was admitted to the hospital for total laryngectomy and neck dissection. The patient had previously undergone primary partial laryngectomy 13 months before, and CT scan showed increased lung markings without metastasis. The patient had moderate general condition with 3 cm of mouth opening, ECG with right bundle block, and Malampatti grade II.

Course of Hospitalization:
General anesthesia with midazolam, sufentanil, vecuronium, and propofol was induced, followed by an attempted tracheal intubation using Macintosh laryngoscopy after preoxygenation. However, the epiglottis and glottis were not viewed under Macintosh laryngoscopy, and then SPO2 dropped from 98% to 85%. Meanwhile, the mask ventilation was ineffective. Placement of neither an oropharyngeal airway nor a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) could resolve the difficult ventilation, which was accompanied by a quick drop of SPO2 to 25% and an increased heart rate to 150 bpm. Urgent tracheostomy was performed by a standby otolaryngologist, and then SPO2 and heart rate recovered after oxygen delivery through the placement of a coiled tracheal tube of 7.0 mm diameter. Anesthesia was maintained with continuous infusion of propofol, remifentanil, and inhalational sevoflurane. The patient emerged without sequelae from the short episode of hypoxia after the surgery was over.

A differential diagnosis was established, which included periodic paralysis, myasthenia gravis, adult-onset Still’s disease, fibromyalgia, and chronic fatigue syndrome. To rule out the possibility of these diseases, a series of tests were conducted, including an antigen-based rapid diagnostic test for influenza virus and testing for circulating anti-nuclear, anti-acetylcholine receptor, and anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. The patient was also tested for coxsackievirus and echovirus.

The patient was finally diagnosed with severe epidemic myalgia caused by HPeV-3 infection. The virus was detected in the patient's stool and blood samples, as well as his son's stool sample. It was confirmed that his son transmitted the HPeV-3 virus to him. The patient's parents, wife, and newborn daughter were tested for the virus, but all their results were negative.

The patient's severe myalgia, fever, and orchiodynia gradually improved without any specific treatment. The patient's cytokine levels were also measured at the initial visit and 2 weeks later, and while his TNF-α, IL-10, and IL-12 levels were below their respective cutoff values, his IL-6 level was elevated at both visits.

The patient had no difficulty moving his whole body after a week, and there were no residual symptoms or sequelae.

Final Diagnosis:

Severe epidemic myalgia caused by HPeV-3 infection.

Patient N. 2, a 60-year-old female diagnosed with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) for ten years, was admitted for evaluation of irritating symptoms of eye discomfort. Symptoms were scored as 74 out of 100 on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and 85 mm out of 100 on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in the right eye (RE) and 22 out of 100 on OSDI and 21 mm out of 100 on VAS in the left eye (LE). Slit lamp evaluation revealed reduced Tear Film Break-Up Time (TFBUT) in both eyes. The patient had been previously treated with various tear substitutes but none were successful in symptom relief. A therapy with hyaluronic acid (HA) based tear substitute was prescribed four times per day in both eyes.

In March 2016, the patient was proposed to receive compassionate unconventional therapy with topical CBS in the right eye (RE) to relieve pain symptoms for which the previous therapeutic attempts had turned out to be unsuccessful. The therapy in the contralateral left eye (LE) was maintained with HA based tear substitutes. The patient signed a specifically designed informed consent for the CBS eye drops administration and the posology of 0.4 ml (8 drops) in RE was given each day for two months. In the GFdosages determined for the two CBS lots were administered during the first and second month.

In September 2016, the patient reported a significant relief from subjective symptoms of discomfort. The OSDI score in the RE was 28 out of 100 and VAS was 32 mm out of 100. In the LE, OSDI score was 16 out of 100 and VAS was 15 mm out of 100. During this visit, IOP was measured which resulted in the normal range in both eyes and the analyses of the visual field tests performed since 2006. A significant progressive lowering in MD values was observed, which was followed by an important amelioration in correspondence with the period of CBS therapy, either in the treated right eye or in the untreated left eye. Furthermore, a change was recorded in PSD values after the CBS eye drop treatment in both the treated RE and the untreated LE.

The improvement is also demonstrated by the analysis of the visual field tests before, at the end, and four months from the end of the CBS eye drop treatment. An amelioration of the visual field defect was observed in both the treated RE and the untreated LE.

Overall, the patient's response to the CBS therapy was positive, which could suggest a neural cross-talk mechanism between the eyes. The patient was discharged in stable condition.",,,1

Reason for Hospitalization:
The patient presented to our emergency department with a two-day history of bleeding from her left breast. She had a slowly enlarging growth on her left breast for the past two years, which initially started as a small papular lesion in the nipple areolar complex. Most recently, the mass became ulcerated with active serous discharge, forcing her to report to the ED.

History of Present Illness:
For the past two days prior to presentation, she developed significant bleeding and oozing from the ulcerated mass with associated localized breast pain. Physical examination revealed a large fungating mass of >10 cm in size, occupying most of the mid and outer breast with a distortion of the nipple areolar complex. There were several open wounds with active bleeding and a foul smell. The area of erythema was noted. The provisional diagnosis was breast cancer with possible metastasis.

Past Medical History:
The patient had no prior personal or family history of skin and breast cancers. She had no history of excessive exposure to sunlight, radiation exposure, arsenic ingestion, or history of immunosuppression. She also had a history of high blood pressure.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent workup to further characterize the mass and assess for metastasis. The imaging studies revealed a large mass in the left breast and a calcified granuloma in the right lung field, in addition to mildly enlarged left axillary lymph nodes. No evidence of metastasis was identified in the abdomen and pelvis. Trucut excisional biopsy of the mass was performed. After histopathological exam for the dissected tissue and lymph nodes, a final diagnosis of invasive cutaneous basal cell carcinoma was made. The margins were tested negative for carcinoma. All the dissected 16 lymph nodes were negative for cancer. The patient subsequently underwent left modified radical mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection.

Condition at Discharge:
The patient's breast cancer with possible metastasis was diagnosed as invasive cutaneous basal cell carcinoma. After surgery, the patient's condition improved and she was discharged home with subsequent treatment and oncology follow-up scheduled.

The patient, a male infant born small for gestational age at 33 weeks, was admitted to our center due to persistent hypoglycemia on DOL 5. The infant had a low birth weight and length and was born to a 35-year-old mother with gestational diabetes and pregnancy-induced hypertension. There was no family history of hypoglycemia reported, however, the maternal grandmother had a history of type 2 diabetes. The infant received initial treatment for hypoglycemia with dextrose 10% IVF and increased oral feeds. The infant also received hydrocortisone treatment secondary to low cortisol levels. After discontinuing hydrocortisone therapy, hypoglycemia recurred, and the pediatric endocrinology team was consulted. High-dose ACTH stimulation testing was performed due to random low cortisol level and the infant responded adequately.

Diagnosis:
The infant was diagnosed with Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI). DNA sequencing for CHI revealed a heterozygous pathogenic missense variant in exon 7 of HNF4A, (p.Arg267Cys; c.799C > T; legacy Arg245Cys), which affected a highly conserved amino acid and has been previously detected in patients with MODY 1.

Treatment:
The infant was started on diazoxide at 15 mg/kg/day with good response. Diazoxide was gradually tapered based on point-of-care (POC) home glucose values in the range of 70-100 mg/dL and eventually discontinued at 6 months of age. The fasting challenge test was not performed before total discontinuation of diazoxide. The infant remained euglycemic at the time of his last visit at 2 years 9 months of age.

Hospital Course:
The patient is a 44-year-old previously healthy Asian female who arrived at the neurology clinic with complaints of persistent and uncomfortable needle-like sensations in her genitalia that extended to the anal area and coccyx. The patient had been experiencing the symptoms for approximately 11 years, but multiple gynecological and dermatological consults were unsuccessful in arriving at a clear diagnosis or relief.

Symptoms were described as more of an irritation and discomfort than actual pain and were aggravated during rest and periods of inactivity, particularly at night. The patient reported brief improvement when taking mefenamic acid tablets for four to five hours. The discomfort was worse before her menstrual cycle. The patient consulted a homeopathy practitioner, who prescribed oral and topical medication. Those were unsuccessful, and as a result, she stopped visiting doctors for some time.

The patient reported no history of back pain, sensory symptoms in the legs, urinary incontinence, or neurological disorder. The neurological and gynecological examinations, as well as MRI of the spine, were normal. Similarly, the biochemical profile and abdominal and pelvic ultrasounds were unremarkable.

After considering her circadian rhythm variations in symptoms and aggravation on rest, RGS was considered the most likely cause for her symptoms. After a detailed discussion with the patient, the neurologist prescribed ropinirole at 0.5mg once at night. The dose was then increased to twice daily after seven days, to which the patient responded well and reported a dramatic relief of symptoms after 14 days. The dose was increased to 1mg in the morning and 0.5mg at night, which led to further improvement. The dose of ropinirole was maintained for one month.

At her three-month follow-up, the patient reported only one episode of pain and itching when she missed her medication for a few days. Otherwise, she had no complaints, and no side effects of the medication were reported.

955,"Patient Information:
The patient is a 2-month-old African American infant who presented to the emergency department with respiratory distress and hypoxemia.

Hospital Course:
Upon arrival, the patient was hypoxic with oxygen saturations of 20–30% and hypothermic to 32°C. She received a normal saline bolus, a blood culture was drawn, and a dose of ceftriaxone was administered. A rapid sequence intubation was performed to establish airway support. Despite increasing oxygen administration up to 100% FiO2, her oxygen saturation peaked at 80%. The patient was then transferred to a tertiary pediatric medical center.

Upon arrival at the tertiary center, a brief transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was concerning for Tetralogy of Fallot with critical pulmonic stenosis versus atresia. She received additional normal saline bolus, sodium bicarbonate, midazolam, and fentanyl. The infant was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for further stabilization. A prostaglandin drip was initiated with the hope of reopening her ductus arteriosus to increase pulmonary blood flow. Pediatric cardiothoracic surgery evaluated the patient, and the decision was made to perform an emergent Blalock–Taussig (BT) shunt.

The patient underwent modified BT shunt with a 3.5 mm Gore-Tex shunt anastomosing the innominate artery to the main pulmonary artery. There were no complications, and she returned to the PICU for post-op recovery. Daily TTE demonstrated normal biventricular function without pericardial effusion, as well as flow across BT shunt and through both branch pulmonary arteries. On post-op day one, she was extubated and weaned to room air, where she was able to maintain oxygen saturations around 88%. By post-op day two, she was tolerating oral feeds. She was discharged home on post-op day four with 40.5 mg of aspirin daily to help prevent shunt thrombosis.

Outcome:
The patient demonstrated a vast difference in her general appearance and energy level upon discharge.

Plan:
The plan is to take the infant back to the operating room to perform a complete repair with a transannular patch at 4–6 months of life.

Follow-up:
The patient will require continued follow-up with pediatric cardiology.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Soft Tissue Plasmacytoma

HOSPITAL COURSE

The patient was admitted to the hospital with a gradually increasing mass located in the soft tissue of the oral cavity. The pathology report showed increased infiltration of the buccal mucosa with monoclonal plasma cells, and the diagnosis of soft tissue plasmacytoma was confirmed. The patient received localized radiotherapy with a total dose of 40 Gy, and the bone marrow biopsy revealed the absence of neoplastic infiltration.

After five years, the patient presented with a painless swelling in his right testis. An ultrasound of the scrotum was performed that showed a hypoechoic mass in the right testicle with increased vascularization, and a normal-appearing left testis. The patient subsequently underwent a right radical orchiectomy and histopathology report showed testicular infiltration by a plasma cell neoplasm with identical immunophenotype to the primary site in the oral cavity. After one year, the patient presented again with painless swelling of his left testis that was attributed to disease relapse.

TREATMENT

The patient refused to undergo left orchiectomy, thus he proceeded with systemic treatment based on lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone. Following 4 cycles of treatment, the patient underwent high dose melphalan with autologous stem cell transplantation. A complete response was achieved with negative PET/CT scan and negative marrow minimal residual disease assessment. The patient continued on lenalidomide maintenance; however, six months later he was diagnosed with disease relapse in his left testicle. Since the patient refused surgery, he was initiated with next-line therapy, with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone, he responded partially and still remains in remission.

FOLLOW-UP

The patient will continue to undergo close monitoring with regular imaging studies to detect any signs of disease relapse. The hospital or the patient's primary care physician should be notified immediately if the patient presents with any new symptoms or complications.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of right lower abdominal pain and vomiting. Physical examination revealed deep tenderness at McBurney’s point without abdominal distension. Laboratory tests showed slight leukocytosis without an elevation of the C-reactive protein level. Enhanced computed tomography scan showed slightly enhanced, thickened appendiceal wall, and inflammatory changes were evident due to appendicitis. Initial diagnosis was mild acute appendicitis based on the physical examination, blood test, and imaging results, and laparoscopic surgery was performed to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

During the laparoscopic surgery, a strangulated small bowel obstruction caused by trapping of ileal bowel loops by a band was observed. After reduction, the band was found to be connecting the right medial umbilical fold to the ileal mesentery, and it was resected using laparoscopic coagulation shears. The band was connected to the ileal mesentery, and neither Meckel’s diverticulum nor ischemic change of the trapped ileum was detected. Appendectomy was also performed as the appendix showed slight inflammatory changes. The patient was discharged without complications on postoperative day 4.

Pathological examination revealed that the band consisted of blood vessels, and it was diagnosed as a vitelline vascular remnant. Furthermore, fecal stones were found on the proximal side of the appendix, and the wall was slightly thickened. Pathological examination revealed diffuse infiltration of lymphocytes and eosinophils throughout the muscularis propria, and the patient was diagnosed with mild chronic appendicitis.

Reason for Admission:
Chronic pelvic pain with acute onset of abdominal pain.

Hospital Course:
On admission, an enlarged right ovary was discovered with ultrasound. A computed tomography (CT) scan was performed revealing a dense right ovarian cyst with moderate volume of free fluid, but no evidence of appendicitis. Tumour markers showed a significantly increased serum CA 125 level of 8142 U/ml which had risen from 115 U/ml over the past 12 months. Additional testing for AFP and hCG levels showed them to be within normal limits.

A gynaecology referral was made and a repeat serum CA 125 level was obtained which showed a lower but still significantly elevated level of 2038 U/ml. A multidisciplinary team consultation was conducted and based on the imaging and serum level, an ovarian endometrioma was suspected with ovarian malignancy being the main differential and unlikely diagnosis.

Laparoscopy was performed which showed bilateral unruptured ovarian endometriomas and multiple endometriotic deposits throughout the abdominal cavity. Surgical excision of endometriosis, bilateral ureterolysis, bilateral excision of endometrioma, and insertion of a Mirena© intrauterine device were performed. Postoperatively, the patient remained stable and was discharged on the third postoperative day.

The patient is a 53-year-old male with a medical history of adenocarcinoma of the lung (T1bN3M1c, cStage IVb) positive for an EGFR gene deletion and cancer-associated disseminated intravascular coagulation. The patient was admitted to the hospital after experiencing a disturbance of consciousness and malaise. Upon admission, the patient had a decreased platelet count, an increased prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (PT-INR), and an increased fibrin degradation product level. Anticoagulant therapy with thrombomodulin alfa was initiated.

After two days of treatment with gefitinib, the patient showed signs of cerebral infarctions. Intravenous unfractionated heparin was administered, and the patient was treated with warfarin. The patient's coagulant profile improved, and he was switched to osimertinib after disease progression during gefitinib treatment. The patient stayed under observation with stable symptoms.

At the end of 11 days of treatment with gefitinib, the patient showed an improvement in the platelet count, and the brain test showed no further cerebral infarction. The patient continued to have leptomeningeal disease progression and eventually expired one month after discontinuation of osimertinib.

Summary of Care:

The patient presented to the hospital with back pain, and the contrast-enhanced CT revealed a 21-mm-diameter nodule in the lower lung with multiple liver and bone metastases. The patient received several tests, and it was determined that the patient's adenocarcinoma of the lung was positive for an EGFR gene deletion. The patient developed Trousseau syndrome, which resulted in cerebral infarctions. The patient was given anticoagulant therapy with thrombomodulin alfa and heparin, and eventually treated with osimertinib. Unfortunately, the patient showed disease progression, and further chemotherapy was not administered. The patient died one month after discontinuation of osimertinib.",,,0

Medical History: No previous long-term medical conditions (diabetes, hypertension, or cancer) or surgical procedures reported.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 20-year-old Sri Lankan male, was admitted to our unit with a complaint of weakness in both hands for one month. He had previously been treated for dengue fever at a local hospital and had made a full recovery. However, five days after discharge, he began to experience weakness in his right hand, which subsequently progressed over time. He presented with an inability to write or button his shirt due to the weakness of his hands. The patient also reported mild weakness in both feet that did not significantly interfere with walking. He did not present with any accompanying numbness, parasthesia or pain.

On general examination, the patient had an average build with no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or signs of malnutrition. The patient showcased some small muscle wasting of bilateral hands and feet. The patient had diminished power asymmetrically graded as 3 out of 5 in the right hand and 4 out of 5 in the left hand. Additionally, all fine finger movements were affected along with some degree of weakness in wrist extension. The patient showcased diminished power grade 4 in distal lower limbs (feet). Bilateral foot dorsiflexion was weak, while ankle jerks were elicited with reinforcement. Knee jerks were elicited without reinforcement and there was no objective sensory impairment of touch, pain, temperature, vibration, and joint position sensations in both upper and lower limbs. No cerebellar signs were demonstrated and his gait showed a minimal degree of high-stepping due to weak dorsiflexion. 

Blood tests revealed white blood cell count: 8.5 × 109/L, platelet count: 274 × 109/L, hemoglobin 12 g/dl with normal red cell indices. The blood picture showed normochromic normocytic cells with some reactive lymphocytes suggestive of a recent viral infection. CSF analysis did not show any increase in proteins or cells and the values were within the normal limits. Anti-GM1 IgM antibody test was not carried out due to the high cost of the test and the patient’s unstable financial background. 

Based on the findings, the patient was diagnosed with multifocal motor neuropathy with conduction blocks. The patient was referred to the neurologist and started on intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) therapy (2 g/kg/day) which was given for 5 days. He showed improvement in his neurological weakness with the treatment and outpatient physiotherapy was arranged.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 34-year-old Chinese woman, gravida 1, para 0, was admitted to our hospital due to thickened nuchal translucency in one fetus of dichorionic diamniotic twins at 13 weeks of pregnancy. The patient underwent noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) at 15 weeks of gestation, which showed a low-risk for fetal 21, 13 and 18 trisomy. However, the results of chromosomal microarray (CMA) analysis at 17 weeks of gestation revealed a gain of the entire short arm of chromosome 12 in approximately 80% of cells in the fetus with thickened nuchal translucency. The twins were confirmed as dizygotic through SNP array analysis.

At 20 weeks of gestation, further abnormalities such as severely shortened humerus and femur (<−6 SD) and mild lateral ventriculomegaly were discovered in the fetus with 12p tetrasomy through an ultrasound. The parents, after careful consideration, opted for selective termination. Transabdominal intrathoracic injection of potassium chloride (KCl) into the heart of the fetus with 12p tetrasomy was performed successfully at 23 weeks of gestation. Ultrasounds were performed regularly, and the remaining fetus showed normal biometric parameters. A healthy female baby, born by normal vaginal delivery at term, was discharged to home.

Vaginal bleeding at 22-weeks gestation

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital due to vaginal bleeding at 22-weeks gestation. Physical examination revealed pelvic pain and uterine contractions, and the patient subsequently expelled a mass vaginally with no fetal contents. Pathology results from the previous hospital showed that the mass was highly cellular and composed of spindle-shaped and multinucleated giant cells with focal myxomatous change. The differential diagnosis included endometrial stromal sarcoma, undifferentiated uterine sarcoma, and primary vaginal sarcoma. The patient underwent examination under anesthesia which demonstrated active bleeding from a defect of the posterior vaginal wall. The cervix was long, closed, and high with no evidence of bleeding, and the fetus had normal heart tones. The patient was discharged in stable condition.

At 27-weeks gestation, the patient was referred to our institution for maternal-fetal medicine and gynecology oncology consultation. She denied any prior gynecologic history or history of infertility issues, and her physical examination was unremarkable. Given the differential diagnosis, MRI was performed which revealed a peri-centimeter cyst in the cervix and a multiloculated cystic structure in the fetal abdomen with no evidence of metastasis. Due to the inability to determine the origin of the cancer, the decision was made to perform a cesarean hysterectomy at 36 weeks. Betamethasone was administered 24 hours apart for two doses as preparation for the procedure.

At 36 weeks and 1 day, the patient underwent a planned exam under anesthesia of the vaginal canal with cesarean hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, and peritoneal biopsies. A male infant was delivered and admitted to NICU due to prematurity. The patient had no palpable or visibly enlarged pelvic/periaortic lymph nodes or evidence of metastatic disease throughout the peritoneal cavity. The final surgical pathology report showed no malignant or neoplastic cells.

At the 3-month follow-up surveillance visit, the patient was noted to have a 1 cm posterior vaginal wall lesion. A biopsy revealed a high-grade sarcoma that was positive for estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. CT scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease, and the patient underwent an upper vaginectomy and proctoscopy. Surgical pathology showed residual sarcoma morphologically similar to the original pathology. All other vaginal biopsies were negative for malignancy. The patient was treated with high dose rate vaginal brachytherapy using a multi-channel vaginal cylinder. A CT scan 36 months after surgery showed no evidence of disease, and the patient remains disease-free 58 months after completion of vaginal brachytherapy.

Discharge Diagnosis:
High-grade sarcoma of the posterior vaginal wall, treated with upper vaginectomy and proctoscopy and high dose rate vaginal brachytherapy

History and Examination:
The patient is a 59-year-old female with a previous diagnosis of primary mammary carcinoma of the axilla with metastasis which caused encasement of multiple veins and arteries. The patient has undergone multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy with subsequent progression of the disease. The patient presented at our pain clinic with intractable pain in the right upper extremity after failed management of opioids, gabapentin, and methadone.

Diagnostic Tests:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brachial plexus revealed a mass encasing the right brachial plexus at the level of the divisions and cords with encasement of the right brachial artery as well. Diagnostic brachial plexus block was also performed to assess the effects of nerve block on the patient's symptoms. 

Procedures:
Given the success of the diagnostic nerve block, the patient was offered chemical neurolytic brachial plexus block with dehydrated ethanol and the patient elected to proceed to a right brachial plexus nerve block. 

Complications:
No complications were noted post-procedure.

Patient Name: [REDACTED] 
Gender: Nonbinary (Presumed Female at Birth) 
Age: 28 
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course: 
The patient was admitted with polycythemia, presenting with hemoglobin 168 g/L and hematocrit 0.49, both within the male reference range. The primary care physician had previously referred the patient due to concerns regarding polycythemia, which signaled elevated hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. It was found that the patient had been undergoing full masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel for approximately six months.

After conducting a thorough evaluation, it was observed that the patient's hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count had increased to the male reference range, as expected after 6 months of masculinizing testosterone therapy. Smoking cessation was advised as continued smoking can also increase hematocrit.

No changes in platelet count or white blood cells were observed. Ferritin reference ranges were considered in the context of iron status and were interpreted according to the patient's circumstances. The patient was informed that interpretation of iron studies for individuals who have a ferritin below the male reference range should be guided by red cell indices. The premenopausal female reference range was used for the same interpretation of ferritin levels in trans individuals who are menstruating or pregnant.

The patient was informed that the reference ranges of the affirmed gender should be utilized. As such, the male reference range would be most appropriate for this nonbinary individual, who was advised to be mindful of this when reviewing their own results.

Recommendations:
1. Continue with full-dose masculinizing hormone therapy with transdermal testosterone gel.
2. Smoking cessation recommended to decrease hematocrit and reduce risk of cardiovascular disease.
3. Be mindful of reference ranges when interpreting lab results.
4. Follow up with primary care physician as recommended.",,,0

History of Presenting Illness:
The patient, a 27-year-old woman, was admitted with a one-month history of facial edema, weight loss, and acne. She had previously sought medical attention at a local hospital for facial redness and edema caused by eating a mango, and was treated with dexamethasone for five days. The patient gradually developed severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema over the course of one month. 

Medical History:
The patient had a history of a 5.5-cm mass located in the right posterior lobe of the liver detected by ultrasound in a routine physical examination 16 months ago at a local hospital. However, the patient did not experience any symptoms at that time.

Physical Examination:
Upon hospitalization, the patient was found to have “moon face” and severe facial edema, beard, central deposition of fat with slim extremities and atrophic muscles, and no pretibial edema. The skin was diffused with acne, and both armpits had hyperpigmentation.

Diagnostic Findings:
Laboratory tests revealed that the patient had marked hypokalemia, which did not normalize with oral and intravenous potassium supplementation until spironolactone was added. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance test confirmed diabetes mellitus. Endocrinological investigation identified severe hypercortisolism with loss of circadian rhythm, and plasma ACTH level was elevated to 1157 pg/mL, confirming ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome. MRI and contrasted MRI revealed no pituitary adenoma. Abdominal contrast-enhanced CT scanning revealed that the mass lesion was located in the right adrenal gland and not in the right hepatic posterior lobe. PET/CT showed moderate fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the mass.

Treatment:
Adrenal tumorectomy was performed, and no hypertensive crisis occurred during surgery. A 6.5-cm black mass was found arising from the medial branch of the right adrenal gland. Hematoxylin-eosin staining of the tumor revealed that most of the cells were chromaffin-like cells. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor showed positive staining for chromogranin A (CgA) and CD56, with a Ki67 labeling index of approximately 16% for chromaffin-like cells. ACTH levels decreased from 715 to 14.3 pg/ml one day after surgery, and serum cortisol levels decreased from more than 50 to 10.4 μg/dl. The patient's signs and symptoms of Cushing’s syndrome gradually disappeared within two months, and the hydrocortisone supplementation was discontinued seven weeks postoperatively. CT revealed that the left adrenal gland was almost reduced to the normal size three months later.

This 50-year-old male patient presented with a painless visual field defect in his right eye related to nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). He had a past medical history of diabetes and displayed elevated serum HbA1c levels, and a comprehensive ophthalmic examination with fundoscopy revealed swelling in the right optic disc. A computed tomography of the brain and orbit was performed to rule out compressive optic neuropathy. Treatment was initiated with intravenous steroids. Three months after the initial presentation, the patient experienced worsening visual field disturbances in his right eye and reported impaired red saturation and light brightness. He exhibited a relative afferent pupillary defect with a pale right optic disc on examination. Furthermore, the HVF test revealed a tunnel vision in his right eye and an inferior arcuate scotoma in his left eye. Methylprednisolone was administered daily for five days and oral steroids were gradually tapered. During one-month follow-up, VA remained consistent and the left eye showed the resolving of optic disc swelling; however, the patient's left eye visual field continued to deteriorate to inferior altitudinal scotoma. After conducting a lumbar puncture test and multiple MRIs, it was concluded that the patient developed bilateral sequential NAION.

Date of Discharge: N/A

Reason for Admission:
The patient complained of progressive bilateral hearing loss over 35 years and recurrent acute hearing loss bilaterally. An evaluation was conducted to determine the cause of the hearing loss.

Hospital Course:
During the evaluation, a multilocular schwannoma was identified on the right side, a small IC VS on the T1, and a small intracochlear schwannoma. The patient was presented with three treatment options: resection with a translabyrinthine approach, CyberKnife radiosurgery, or watch-and-scan. After considering the available options, the patient chose to undergo CyberKnife radiosurgery to treat both tumors. Following two cMRI examinations that revealed stable tumors, the patient opted for cochlear implantation on the right side. Two years later, he received cochlear implantation on the left side. As of 12 months postoperatively, the patient had an aided WRS of 35% (FMT) on the right side. The patient uses the CI over 10 hours daily and received a second CI two years after the first one. One year postoperatively, the OLSA test revealed a 4.6 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with CI on the right side and hearing aid on the left side and 11.3 dB for the right side with CI (with masking of the left ear).

Diagnosis:
Bilateral progressive hearing loss

Treatment:
CyberKnife radiosurgery to treat the multilocular schwannoma on the right side and the small intracochlear schwannoma on the T1. Cochlear implantation on the right and left sides.

This is a case report of a 44-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006 and underwent modified radical mastectomy after excisional biopsy revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient was found to have metastatic lung cancer secondary to breast cancer in June 2010, which was treated with an ovariectomy and exemestane. The patient complained of severe cough in March 2014 and was found to have metastases in the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes, as well as a malignant renal mass. Various chemotherapy regimens were employed, but all failed. A biopsy of the metastatic lesion was performed, confirming lung metastasis of breast cancer with increased expression of ER. The patient was started on fulvestrant and zoledronic acid injections in August 2015, and a partial response was achieved with shrinking of the renal mass and improvement in subjective symptoms. The patient was stable for 16 months until December 2016 when she decided to stop taking fulvestrant. The patient died of epilepsia gravior due to brain metastases in November 2018 after being treated with apatinib.

Patient Name: N/A
Medical Record Number: N/A
Discharge Date: N/A

Reason for Hospital Admission:
The patient, a 71-year-old woman, was admitted to the hospital for right retrosigmoid craniotomy and tumor resection.

Hospital Course:
The patient's operation was uneventful, and she was discharged on dexamethasone 6 mg daily for 3 days. Three weeks later, she was readmitted to the hospital with persistent fever and chills, and occasional headaches for five days.

Diagnostic Assessment:
On admission, her vitals were notable for a fever of 38.5 °C, heart rate of 83 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 14 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 158/83 mmHg. A CT scan was ordered, which showed a subgaleal collection overlying the craniotomy site and hypodense areas in the right cerebellum that likely represented postoperative changes. A hypodense extra-axial collection was noted along the right cerebellum. These findings raised concern for postsurgical meningitis, and the patient was started on antibiotics for a presumptive urinary tract infection. However, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, with the development of nuchal rigidity, altered mental status, and seizures in the next 24 hours. A lumbar puncture was performed, which showed significant inflammation in the cerebrospinal fluid. The patient was then taken to the operating room for placement of an external ventricular drain and intrathecal antibiotic administration. A pathology report revealed fungal elements, and further testing confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus as the causative agent.

Treatment:
The patient was started on liposomal amphotericin and voriconazole for the treatment of CNS aspergillosis, which was eventually transitioned to oral voriconazole 250 mg every 12 hours to complete three months of therapy. The patient's mental status improved markedly over the following days, and she was transferred to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy.

Follow-Up:
The patient was followed up at four months, during which time she was fully alert, and her verbal communication was almost back to baseline. No focal or meningeal signs were noted on examination, and a brain MRI showed complete resolution of leptomeningeal enhancement with no collections.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with CNS aspergillosis.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient, a 72-year-old male with a past medical history significant for CLL, was admitted to the hospital after presenting to the emergency department with headache and seizure-like activity. The patient's initial workup including CT of the head, EEG evaluation, CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND PELVIS CT, and infectious workup with blood culture, urine culture, quantiferon-TB, histoplasma, blastomyces, influenza, RPR screen, and HIV were all negative. However, a lumbar puncture revealed cerebrospinal fluid with elevated WBC and protein levels, indicative of a neurological issue. The patient was started on anticonvulsants and transferred to our institution for further workup and management.

Over the course of his hospitalization, the patient's neurological status continued to decline despite treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals. A repeat CT of the head showed hydrocephalus, and an external ventricular drain was placed, but there was no improvement in the patient's status. Ultimately, the patient expired within two weeks after he presented with the neurologic symptoms after support was withdrawn per family request.

Autopsy of the brain showed diffuse cerebral edema with right-sided predominance on gross findings. There were multiple areas of hemorrhagic necrosis including the bilateral frontal lobe, right parasagittal posterior frontal lobe, left temporal lobe, bilateral medial occipital lobe, and paraventricular areas. Microscopic findings revealed parenchymal necrosis with mixed inflammation, amebic trophozoites, and occasional cysts. This mixed infiltrate was seen involving the meninges. The amebas were prominent around vessels, and occasional multinucleated giant cells were seen. The autopsy brain was sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and immunohistochemical stains were performed, which identified Acanthamoeba species with no evidence of Naegleria fowleri. His final diagnosis based on autopsy was necrotizing meningoencephalitis with morphologic and immunohistochemical evidence of Acanthamoeba species.

Recommendations:
The patient's family was advised of the autopsy findings and advised to seek appropriate medical follow-up, considering their risk factors for the same. This discharge summary was dictated and reviewed with the patient's family.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to an episode of tonic-clonic seizure. She had a medical history of hypertension and was diagnosed with stage 4 gastric adenocarcinoma with metastasis two years ago. Brain MRI with and without contrast was performed, which showed bilateral, symmetric T2-FLAIR hyperintensity in the occipital and posterior parietal lobes suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). The multidisciplinary tumor board committee indicated that this condition could be due to the toxic effect of trastuzumab or hypertension. The patient was discharged on levetiracetam with the plan to continue trastuzumab, strictly manage blood pressure and repeat the MRI in three months. The patient's blood pressure was under control during the follow-up tests. However, a repeated MRI with and without contrast revealed persistent T2-FLAIR hyperintensity in the occipital and posterior parietal lobes suggestive of PRES. The tumor board recommended holding trastuzumab for one month. During this period, the patient presented to the hospital with worsening epigastric pain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a large, malignant-appearing, partially obstructing mass in the gastric body with no active bleeding. 

Discharge Medications: Not specified 

Follow-up Instructions:
The patient requires follow-up for the previously diagnosed stage 4 gastric adenocarcinoma and PRES. The tumor board has recommended the cessation of trastuzumab for one month; the continuation of prescribed medication for hypertension management; and repeat MRI in three months to monitor PRES. The patient should continue to receive oncology follow-up care as previously scheduled.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our facility with a chief complaint of blurred vision in his left eye. His history revealed that he had received intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide for a misdiagnosis of uveitis along with dexamethasone injections, intravitreal injection of conbercept, and laser photocoagulation at another hospital, yet he experienced no improvement. Upon examination, his left eye was found to have non-rhegmatogenous retinal detachment with multifocal exudative lesions in the posterior pole. Additionally, intraocular TA was discovered in the nasal retina. 

The patient underwent a 50% dose of verteporfin photodynamic therapy under the guidance of indocyanine green angiography. One month later, an ophthalmic B scan revealed reduced bullous retinal detachment, whereas OCT revealed a decrease in subretinal fluid (SRF). Three months after the procedure, ophthalmoscopy and an ophthalmic B scan displayed complete resolution of the exudative retinal detachment, whereas fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) showed hypofluorescence and indocyanine green angiography revealed hypofluorescence in the lesion area. SRF on the OCT image disappeared, and the macula regained normal anatomy structure.

Discharge Diagnosis: Ovarian cystic teratoma with primary invasive urothelial carcinoma (TNM stage pT1aNxMx)

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 50-year-old lady, presented to the Pondicherry Institute of Medical Sciences Hospital with a complaint of acute abdominal pain. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CECT) demonstrated the presence of bilateral ovarian mature cystic teratomas, with contrast enhancement within the right ovarian cyst suggesting the possibility of malignant transformation. Tumor marker CA-125 was found to be within normal range. The patient underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Gross examination showed the right ovary to be cystic with a smooth surface except for an area with blunt pale soft projections and the left ovary was grossly normal. Microscopic examination of the ovary with soft pale projections showed papillary structures with fibrovascular cores which were lined by transitional epithelium exhibiting nuclear pleomorphism, hyperchromatism, and increased mitotic activity. There was evidence of invasion of the ovarian stroma by nests of malignant epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) of the urothelial carcinoma showed cytoplasmic and membrane positivity for Uroplakin II. A diagnosis of ovarian cystic teratoma with primary invasive urothelial carcinoma was made based on the Pathological Stage Classification by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 8th edition. 

Follow-up: 
The patient was reviewed till 3 months following surgery and follow-up CECT revealed no evidence of recurrent tumor in the abdomen and pelvis. 

Summary:
The patient was admitted with bilateral ovarian mature cystic teratomas with the possibility of malignant transformation.

The patient was a 31-year-old female who presented with complaints of massive abdominal distention and respiratory distress. She had a history of secondary infertility for four years and had already undergone one IVF cycle which was cancelled due to poor response. The patient was under outpatient care and supportive treatment with possible diagnosis of hyperstimulation syndrome.

Diagnostic Findings:

Trans-abdominal and transvaginal ultrasonography showed multiple multiloculated cystic masses with predominantly solid components in both adnexa. The results of cross-sectional CT-scan and magnetic resonance imaging suggested the ovarian neoplasm. In this time, 4 months after management of hyperstimulation syndrome, due to persistent large ovarian mass and increased tumor marker inhibin more than 3000 pg/mL, she was referred to the oncology department.

Medical Management:

Surgical staging surgery and optimal cytoreductive surgery without fertility preserving were done. At this stage, although pelvic and abdominal cavity appeared normal without any residual disease in the first surgery, one month later in the second surgery, we unpredictably encountered malignant tumor even in the omentum (stage IIIc of disease); so complete cytoreductive surgery was again performed. Then, three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP) were prescribed.

The patient was a recipient of a deceased donor kidney transplant from a 50-year-old man who had a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, acute alcoholic hepatitis, and relapse of C. difficile infection. Due to his potential as a kidney donor, his kidneys were accepted for transplant. However, his liver and heart were not used as grafts. The surgical procedure was uneventful, and the immunosuppression regimen included basiliximab, methylprednisolone, CyA, and MMF.

Despite good graft perfusion, the patient suffered from delayed graft function and required hemodialysis on day 2 after transplantation. An empirical treatment with ceftriaxone was started and later switched to meropenem as extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing (ESBL) Klebsiella pneumoniae was identified in a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) culture from the donor. The patient developed filamentous fungi on a culture plate of the donor's respiratory sample, which was diagnosed as Aspergillus fumigatus. Renal biopsies from the patient were assessed and found to be normal. However, further examination using specific fungal stains revealed filamentous fungi, which confirmed Aspergillus fumigatus by the histopathologist.

Due to the potential presence of invasive aspergillosis (IA), elective nephrectomy was performed on day + 3. The surgery was uneventful, and the graft and vascular sutures were resected. The kidney was found to contain several parenchyma cavitations. A. fumigatus was isolated in samples from the cortex and vascular sutures, and real-time PCR was positive for Aspergillus spp. in both cases. Both patients were followed for 1 year and remain asymptomatic.

Diagnosis:

Delayed graft function due to nephroangiosclerosis, hepatitis C associated–membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and undergoing deceased donor kidney transplantation with 3 HLA mismatches.

Treatment:

Basiliximab, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus, and MMF immunosuppressive treatment was initiated along with liposomal-amphotericin B for patient 1 to minimize drug interactions with azole derivatives and the immunosuppressive therapy he received for the LTx. Voriconazole was chosen for patient 2 on day 1, followed by dosage adjustment as needed.

- Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 6-year-old boy with no history of pathological conditions, was admitted to our hospital after suffering an accidental fall from a 3-meter climbing pole. He experienced pain and deformity in the right elbow and wrist joints and was diagnosed with Bado type III Monteggia injury with ipsilateral fracture of the distal radius and ulna.

The patient received manual reduction under nerve block on the day of injury, but due to the difficulty of maintaining the reduction of the radial head, open reduction and percutaneous procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Kirschner wires were inserted for open reduction and fixation of the fractured distal radius and ulna. A long-arm cast was used for external fixation with the elbow in 90° flexion and the forearm in an intermediate position.

After 2 weeks, callus formation at the fractured bone was observed, and therefore, the cast was removed, and range of motion exercises of the elbow and wrist joints were initiated. The Kirschner wires were removed at 6 weeks postsurgery, and pain, range of motion limitation, and lateral instability were not observed in the elbow or wrist joints at 3 months after surgery.

During the 3-year follow-up, radiographs showed a gradual correction in the outward displacement of the radial head. Twenty-one years after surgery, the patient returned to our hospital for another disorder, and radiographs of the previous Monteggia injury were taken. The biocompatibility of the radiocapitellar joint was good, and no malunion was found in the distal radius and ulna.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 49-year-old woman, was admitted for living renal transplantation due to cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis and end-stage renal disease. She was diagnosed with HCV serotype 2 at the age of 29 during pregnancy. She received interferon therapy and achieved sustained virologic response. Her medical history also included macroglobulinemia and cryoglobulinemia, which were treated with immunosuppressive therapy and DFPP. 

On admission, she presented with a livedo reticularis, hypothermoesthesia, hypoalgesia on the bilateral lower extremities and laboratory studies showed an elevated serum creatinine level, low hemoglobin, platelet count, high rheumatoid factor, and presence of type II cryoglobulins. After 50 days of prednisolone, rituximab, cyclophosphamide, and DFPP treatment, cryoglobulin levels were sufficiently suppressed, and living renal transplantation was performed using the left kidney from her 70-year-old mother. 

Postoperatively, basiliximab, prednisolone, cyclosporin, and mycophenolate mofetil were used for post-transplant immunosuppression. DFPP and rituximab were used as needed to control cryoglobulinemia. The patient remained stable with good graft function and improvement of purpura and neuropathy for 2 years and 6 months, without signs of recurrence.

Diagnosis:
- End-stage renal disease due to cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis
- Hepatitis C virus serotype 2

Chief Complaint: Dyspnoea, chest pain, oedema, weight loss

History of Present Illness: The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea, mid-sternum chest pain, left arm oedema and weight loss. The patient had no known underlying disease.

Diagnostic Studies: Chest radiograph showed mediastinal widening, nodular consolidation in the left lower lobe and pleural effusion. Blood urea nitrogen/creatinine level was elevated, and a CT scan was performed without contrast enhancement. The CT scan showed a huge lobulated mass involving the oesophagus, mediastinum and lower neck with enlarged lymph nodes. Echocardiography and pericardiocentesis were performed revealing pericardial effusion and extraluminal air bubbles along the pericardium. An endoscopic study revealed a huge oesophageal ulcer encircling the oesophageal lumen at 20–30 cm from the incision. Biopsy analysis suggested small cell carcinoma.

Hospital Course: The patient was treated with chemotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide, which markedly decreased the size of the mediastinal mass and improved the dyspnoea and left arm oedema. Antibiotic treatment was administered and improved the pneumonia in the left lower lung.

Outpatient Follow-up Care: Patient received 8 cycles of chemotherapy, producing a partial response. However, multiple brain metastases developed 7 months after the initial diagnosis. A poor prognosis is expected.

The patient, a 72-year-old male, presented at the hospital with a change of personality and weight loss. Cranial MRI revealed a large low contrast-enhancing mass in the right cerebellar hemisphere. The tumor caused occlusive hydrocephalus but no surrounding edema. The suspected diagnoses were metastasis without presence of any neoplasm in the patient history or medulloblastoma (MB). The possibility of a high-grade glioma was discussed but neglected due to its rare occurrence in the cerebellum of this age group. Prior to surgery, an external ventricular drainage was inserted, and complete tumor resection was performed. Histopathological examination showed a highly cellular cerebellar tumor, which was diagnosed as a classical MB (WHO grade IV) with no nodular or desmoplastic component. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the ventricular drainage was removed without evidence of an enlarged ventricular system. The patient was found dead seven days later in his room, and the cause of unexpected death could not be clarified, since an autopsy was not allowed.

Discharge Summary:
This being said, the patient was not discharged as they were found deceased seven days after MB tumor resection surgery. This conclusion was made after the completion of the hospital course which included diagnostic imaging, surgical intervention and postoperative management.",,,0
2207,"Hospital Course:
The 42-year-old male patient presented with proximal muscle weakness that had been ongoing for 1.5 years. A muscle biopsy revealed the presence of polymyositis. Prior to admission to our hospital, the patient had been treated with high dose PDN and MTX with no significant improvement. After a year on this drug regimen, the patient's muscle weakness became worse, and he experienced difficulty swallowing. The patient underwent an increase in PDN dose, and AZA was added. Two IVIG doses were administered; nonetheless, the patient was transferred to our hospital due to a lack of response to the new regimen.

Medical Management:
After comprehensive case review, the patient was started on PDN 75 mg/day and TAC 2 mg twice daily. Due to non-medical reasons, biologics could not be prescribed. The TAC dose was subsequently increased to 4 mg twice daily to achieve a trough goal of 6-10 ng/mL. After one month of initiating TAC, MMF 1500 mg twice daily was successfully added to the patient’s regimen without any complications.

Clinical Course:
Six months after commencing TAC and MMF combination treatment, the patient experienced significant decreases in muscle enzyme levels, decreasing from CK 4419 U/L to 732 U/L and LDH 1402 U/L to 513 U/L. Additionally, clinical improvement was observed, and PDN was tapered to 30 mg/day. At every clinic visit, blood pressure and glycemic levels were monitored. After eleven months of TAC and MMF treatment, LDH and CK normalized and the patient had 3/5 strength on neck flexors and 4/5 strength on hip flexors and quadriceps. No adverse effects have been reported during treatment.",,,0
608,"Hospital Course:
The 9-year, 7-month-old Japanese girl was admitted to our facility with complaints of severe deformity of her right femur associated with a pathological fracture. The patient's past medical history was unremarkable. At the age of 4-years, 6-months old, the patient experienced a pathological fracture of her right femur due to a bone tumor, which was treated with lesion curettage and fixation by her previous physician. The patient experienced a recurrence of the fracture at the same site within a week of removing the fixator, which was treated with conservative management and a hip spica cast. Subsequently, the patient developed two more fractures, following a fall, and underwent steel wire skeletal traction, followed by functional brace and hip spica cast applications. The patient followed up with regular outpatient monitoring, and during the follow-up period, a severe bowing of her right femur developed, which was progressive.

Clinical Management:
The patient was treated with resection of a 7-cm portion of the bone, which included the SBC, corrected the alignment and applied an Ilizarov fixator to gradually lengthen the thigh. A portion of healthy bone from the proximal femur (approximately 10 cm from the resected lesion) was cut, for use as bone extension at the site of resection. Extension of the bone was initiated at a speed of 1 mm/day, completing the process in 4 months. Fixation was maintained until the callus matured. Once callus maturation was achieved, the external fixator was gradually removed to prevent re-deformation.

Histopathologic Examination:
On histopathologic examination of the surgically resected bone, fibrillation of the medullary cavity was increased, and a small formation, identified as inorganic-like material, was scattered throughout; these findings were consistent with a fracture due to a bone cyst.

Physical Examination:
On the first examination at our facility, the femur was deformed, with a bowing of approximately 90° in the central area of the femur and an internal rotation of 60°, with incomplete fractures observable in the same area. At present, 3 years after surgery, correction of the deformity has been maintained, and the patient does not experience any limitations in daily activities or regular exercise.

Diagnosis:
Severe femur deformity in a 9-year, 7-month-old Japanese girl associated with a pathological fracture due to bone cyst and recurrent fractures in the same location.

Follow-up Plan:
The patient will follow up at regular intervals for monitoring of the healed bone and to ensure that the patient does not experience any limitations in daily activities or regular exercise.",,,0

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a 4-month history of abdominal pain and weight loss, and was diagnosed with nonspecific adenitis following retroperitoneal lymph node biopsy. Due to persistent abdominal pain and left inguinal pain, a large left retroperitoneal fluid collection was discovered and percutaneous drainage was performed. Analysis of the drained fluid revealed high levels of protein and triglycerides compatible with chyle, raising suspicion of cisterna chyli injury.

Conservative management with a low-fat diet, medium-chain triglycerides, and octreotide was established, but the pigtail output was maintained at 1500 to 2000 mL per day for 2 weeks. For these reasons, the decision was taken to use surgical management. Lymphangiography was performed and a laparoscopic transperitoneal approach was used to identify the chyle collection and perform selective ligation using a 3-0 polyglactin suture, encompassing the area of leakage, and n-butyl cyanoacrylate. Pathological lymph nodes were identified and extirpated for pathological analysis, resulting in a diagnosis of seminoma.

After operation, the drainage output diminished from ∼1500 to 2000 mL per day to <500 mL per day. The patient was started on chemotherapy using a cisplatin plus etoposide regimen and also remained under conservative treatment for chyle leakage, with gradual reduction of pigtail output.

This is a discharge summary for a 44-year-old female with a history of asthma, essential hypertension, class 3 obesity, depression, and poor social and economic background. The patient was intermittently followed during the previous four years for persistent cutaneous candidiasis with intertrigo in the inframammary, inguinal, and lower abdominal regions. The patient was treated with topical antifungal, oral fluconazole and oral itraconazole with no improvement.

The patient presented with a worsening in the skin rash with exudate, pruritus, and a change to a violaceous colour, with scaly papules and vesicles. A skin biopsy showed orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis in the epidermis with areas of parakeratosis and, in the papillary dermis, there was an infiltrate of cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and reniform nuclei that showed positive CD1a and S100 proteins on the immunohistochemistry and negative CD163.

After considering the skin histology, the extensive cutaneous involvement, and the infiltrative urothelial involvement, it was evident this was a multi-system process. A consultation with Hematology/Oncology, led to induction treatment with prednisolone and vinblastine-based chemotherapy. At six weeks of chemotherapy, there was a partial regression of the skin lesions and a resolution of the urothelium lesion in imaging exam.

The disease was in continuous regression and considering the extension of affected skin tissue a second round of chemotherapy with prednisolone and vinblastine was administered for six weeks. There was a resolution of all the lesions following this second round, and the patient underwent maintenance therapy consisting of administrating mercaptopurine daily and prednisolone/vinblastine every three weeks during 12 months, staying in remission.

Six months after the end of maintenance therapy the patient had a recurrence of the disease and started second-line chemotherapy with clofarabine and cytosine arabinoside (ARA-C). The patient did not comply with the treatment and the disease progressed. As a result of skin ulceration, she developed skin and soft tissue infection that evolved into septic shock and did not survive despite intensive care support.",,,0

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 46-year-old nulliparous woman, presented with progressively increasing pain in the right side of her groin and labia majora, along with a growing lump. She had previously undergone three laparotomies for ovarian cystectomy. Pathology reports indicated ovarian endometriosis. She underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophorectomy and excision of a 3.7 × 2.5 cm labial mass, which revealed adenomyosis, multiple leiomyomas in the uterus, and endometriotic cysts in both ovaries. The labial mass contained focal atypical endometriosis on a background of benign endometriosis. One month prior to her visit, she had undergone biopsy of the labial mass at a provincial hospital, which showed apocrine hidrocystoma. However, the mass continued to increase in size with progressive pain.

Upon presentation at our hospital, a hard mass measuring 7x4-cm was found at the right labia majora extending to the right groin area. A computed tomography scan revealed an ulcerative mass at the right labia majora and nodal metastasis at the bilateral external iliac and superficial inguinal regions. A biopsy showed a papillary growth structure lined by round tumor cells with clear cytoplasm and pleomorphic nucleoli. The tumor exhibited cytoplasmic staining for napsin A. The diagnosis of clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vulva with coexisting atypical endometriosis was made based on these pathological findings.

Systemic chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and carboplatin was administered, but the tumors progressed after the first two cycles. Palliative treatment was initiated, and the patient received pelvic radiation to alleviate pelvic pain. The patient passed away due to the progression of the disease and severe sepsis 17 months after her initial presentation.

Patient Name: [redacted]

Age: 20 years

Clinical History:
The patient presented for an assessment in preparation for orthognathic surgery. On examination, a 1.5 cm diameter exophytic midline tongue lesion was noted, which had been present since birth with no change since childhood. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of his tongue was obtained, suggesting a 1.5 cm protuberant mass arising from the dorsal aspect of the tongue in the midline at the approximate junction of the oral component and base.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent surgical excision of the tongue lesion, which was subsequently submitted for histological examination. The lesion was found to be a leiomyomatous hamartoma, characterized by a combination of fibrovascular connective tissue, smooth-muscle bundles, skeletal muscle fibers, adipose tissue, salivary tissue, blood vessels, lymphoid tissue, peripheral nerves, and ganglion cells. There was no evidence of nuclear atypia, cellular pleomorphism, mitosis, or necrosis, consistent with the benign and developmental nature of these lesions.

Hospital course:
The patient, a 62-year-old male, presented with a recurrent left nasal bulbar conjunctival lesion, which was diagnosed as SCC. The lesion had been previously managed through multiple interventions, including a left nasal pterygium removal, a wide local excision, Plaque Therapy, and re-excision with adjuvant cryotherapy. The recurrence was managed through SXRT due to the patient declining enucleation. The patient also had a history of Crohns Colitis, which was treated with immunotherapy, and a previous excision of a non-melanoma skin cancer from the right temple with a subsequent skin graft of the area.

Hospital course events:
The patient was prescribed a dose of 48.4 Gy in 22 fractions, to a depth of 3 mm. A 2.0 cm diameter direct applicator was used with a 3 mm margin on the treatment region, and the left inner canthus and tear duct were included in the treatment field. A single en-face beam of 2.0 mm Aluminium energy (2 mm Al) was used to meet the dose prescription. Risk of ulceration, scleral perforation, ischemia, and nasolacrimal duct obstruction was explained to the patient. Topical anaesthesia (Tetracaine eyedrops) was administered to the left eye prior to retractors positioning, and lubricating eye drops were prescribed for use prior to treatment administration to prevent dryness of the ocular surface. The total set up and treatment time for this patient was approximately 20 min, with the retractors in place on average less than 10 min.

The patient was admitted to the medical service after a fall that caused her to present with nonspecific lower abdominal pain and unintentional weight loss. During her stay, she was found to have microcytic hypochromic anemia and leukocyte esterase on urine analysis. Abdominal ultrasound showed mild ascites and dilated common bile duct to 1 cm. During her stay, her CEA was found to be high, while her hemoglobin dropped to 6.2 gm/dL, requiring blood transfusions. Her respiratory status declined due to acute respiratory failure and bilateral infiltrates necessitating her transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit (MICU) where she was intubated. Her echocardiography showed mitral stenosis and severe pulmonary hypertension with normal ejection fraction. Her respiratory status improved, and she was transferred back to the medical floor after staying four days in the MICU. After transfer, she developed abdominal distension, and a CT scan revealed colonic distension with a left-sided colonic mass and retroperitoneal free fluid. A laparotomy was performed, and several adhesions were noticed that caused a high-grade small bowel obstruction with a transition point in the mid ileum.

Diagnosis: Chronic phase-CML; Low-grade follicular lymphoma

History and Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a three-week history of dyspnea, headache, and lower extremity edema. Leukocytosis was observed in the patient’s initial labs, which revealed marked hyperplasia of segmented neutrophils. The patient underwent bone marrow biopsy which revealed the existence of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm consistent with chronic phase-CML.

Additionally, stress echocardiogram and CT chest with contrast enhancement were carried out to evaluate the patient for intermittent dyspnea, leading to the detection of mediastinal, cervical, and supraclavicular adenopathy. The patient subsequently underwent an excisional biopsy of the cervical lymph node, which revealed chronic phase-CML and FL, with fewer than 15 centroblasts per high-power field.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed co-expression of the pan-B cell marker CD20, the germinal center marker CD10, and BCL2 and BCL6. Furthermore, qualitative RT-PCR of the node and fluorescence in situ hybridization confirmed follicular lymphoma and the CML-type Mbcr (p210) fusion protein, respectively.

The patient did not present with any symptoms of anemia during their hospital course. There was no indication of pulmonary embolism. PD-L1 expression was low (10%), while EBV was negative both by IHC for the viral latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) and by Epstein–Barr encoding region in situ hybridization (EBER).

The patient, a 62-year-old Japanese female, was admitted to our surgical outpatient clinic due to a left abdominal mass. A clinical examination revealed a painless, child-head-sized tumor located in the left upper abdomen and abdominal CT demonstrated a child-head-sized mass with heterogeneous contrast. Subsequent MRI revealed a heterogeneously hyperintense mass on T1-weighted imaging, a relatively uniform and hyperintense mass on T2-weighted imaging, and a hypointense mass with an enhanced border on gadolinium-enhanced imaging. Laboratory data indicated slightly elevated levels of ACTH, but otherwise normal electrolytes and hematological markers.

The patient underwent tumor resection surgery and the multilobular yellow mass was found to weigh 1500 g with bleeding in places. Histopathological examination revealed that the tumor was composed of a proliferation of mature and variable-sized adipocytes admixed with aggregates of hematopoietic elements, associated with adrenal gland tissue in the peripheral region within the tumor. These findings were compatible with AML.

The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 6th day after the operation. She has been followed up in our outpatient clinic without recurrence for approximately 12 years since undergoing the operation.

Admission Date: 8 August 2019
Discharge Date: N/A

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted due to back pain and cough.

Medical History:
The patient has been exposed to chemicals due to his occupation as a farmer and had a history of smoking for 40 years.

Diagnostic Test Results:
A thoracic CT scan revealed a malignant tumor in the left upper lobe that was complicated by distal obstructive inflammation, the enlargement of left hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, and multiple bone metastases. IHC and histopathologic observations confirmed the diagnosis of stage IVb lung adenocarcinoma with bone metastases. A 733-gene NGS panel indicated the presence of an EGFR exon 19 p.L747_S752del somatic mutation and TP53 p.H179L germline mutation. NGS-based CNV analyses showed the whole chromosome 7 and 5q deletion, which are associated with secondary MDS. The physiological blood indexes and bone marrow aspiration test confirmed MDS.

Hospital Course:
The patient was administered with gefitinib for the EGFR-positive mutation and azacitidine for four courses of treatment due to decreasing platelet counts. However, the thrombocytopenia had not been significantly improved, and maximal tumor size did not decrease after seven months’ treatment. Due to infiltration of poorly differentiated cancer cells in the fibrous tissue, the patient was diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumor with small cell carcinoma and atypical carcinoid tumor accounting for about 40% and 60%, respectively. Positive PD-L1 expression and high TMB in the tissue sample led to the administration of toripalimab and bevacizumab. The patient's platelet counts gradually returned to near-normal levels, and the tumor lesion shrunk obviously.

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Medical Record Number: [Redacted]
Date of Discharge: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 26-year-old right-handed white woman with a history of multiple sclerosis (MS), was admitted to the hospital on [Redacted]. She was diagnosed with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) based on a surveillance MRI of her brain that showed asymmetric confluent non-enhancing hyperintensities in the bilateral subcortical precentral gyri consistent with PML. Cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) showed quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for JC virus (JCV) and a diagnosis of PML was made based on compatible neuroimaging findings along with the presence of JCV DNA in the CSF. 

Treatment was initiated with orally administered mefloquine loading dose followed by 250 mg weekly and mirtazapine 15 mg daily. Repeat MRI after two months showed no changes in her brain lesions, but mild dysmetria of her left hand was noticed by the patient at three months after diagnosis. A repeat brain MRI revealed a few small enhancing lesions in her left frontal lobe suggestive of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). She was treated with intravenously administered immunoglobulin followed by high-dose methylprednisolone and restarted on glatiramer acetate for MS treatment.

Five months following the diagnosis, a repeat brain MRI showed interval development of T2 signal abnormality with mild enhancement in multiple areas including the brainstem, cerebellum, and bilateral cerebral hemispheres. Given the MRI findings, she was treated with high-dose intravenously administered methylprednisolone for a total of six courses until there was significant resolution of enhancement on her brain MRI. The patient was then transitioned from glatiramer acetate to ocrelizumab for MS treatment.

At 1-year follow-up, the patient reported residual left-hand dysmetria and tremor and right upper extremity phasic spasms. Her Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score was 2.0.

Patient: 10-year-old boy with widespread heterotopic ossification

Hospital course:

The patient was admitted to our outpatient department with complains of multiple bony hard swellings in the back and both the arms since the last eight years. The patient had undergone surgery of a swelling in his proximal arm previously, but the swelling recurred and restriction in movements persisted. Gradually, multiple swellings appeared over bilateral infrascapular regions, and the shoulder movements became restricted with time leading to severe limitation of his activities of daily living. The patient had difficulty in feeding himself along with an inability to dress and undress at the time of presentation.

On examination, bony hard swellings were present over bilateral parascapular and infrascapular regions extending up to the lower dorsal spine, which severely restricted all the shoulder movements bilaterally. Non-tender bony hard swellings were present in both the arms primarily on medial and posterior aspects, which were associated with fixed flexion deformity of 90° at both the elbow joints with a further 10° flexion movement possible. There was a severe restriction of the neck flexion and extension movements, while the hip movements were also severely restricted on both sides. The patient also had hallux valgus present bilaterally along with microdactyly of the great toes.

Diagnostic findings:

On plain radiographs, heterotopic ossification was seen in the soft tissues around humerus on both sides, extending through the axilla to the chest wall, along left side of the neck on radiograph of cervical spine, as well as the pelvis with bilateral hips. Bony outgrowth like appearance due to ossification along ligamentous insertion on right lateral distal femoral metaphyses as well as bilateral proximal medial tibial metaphyses producing pseudoexostoses were revealed on the radiographs of both the knees. Bilateral hallux valgus with monophalangism of the great toes was found in the radiographs of both feet.

Diagnosis:

Based on the presence of congenital bilateral great toe anomalies and progressive widespread heterotopic ossification in the characteristic anatomic pattern, a clinical diagnosis of FOP was arrived at.

Plan:

The patient’s relatives were counselled about the prognosis and lack of definite treatment and cure for the disease. They were also informed about the presence of support groups like International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association (IFOPA) to advocate, support and connect patients, and their families, afflicted with this debilitating disorder.

Patient: 66-year-old Caucasian male

Diagnosis: Actinic Keratosis

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to the primary care clinic with a raised, scaly lesion on the dorsum of his left hand with marginal erythema. The lesion was diagnosed as Actinic Keratosis, and the possibility of Basal and Squamous cell carcinoma was considered due to the patient's medical history.

The patient had a previous history of Basal Cell Carcinoma, Seborrheic Keratoses, and Actinic Keratosis. The previous Basal Cell Carcinoma had been treated successfully with topical imiquimod treatment in six weeks.

The patient was then enrolled in a clinical trial that examined the use of Kanuka honey on rosacea. The patient opted for topical application of Honevo® medical grade Kanuka honey (90% Kanuka honey, 10% glycerin) once daily. A small amount of honey was applied on the fingertip and rubbed into the lesion and surrounding normal skin for 10-30 seconds. It was left on for 30-60 minutes and then washed off with water. The patient followed this regimen for three months, with a two-day treatment break due to tenderness of the lesion. The lesion gradually reduced in size, with an initial rapid reduction in its dry, crusted nature.

After three months, the residual lesion measured 20mm by 17mm with no elements of hypertrophy, crusting, or loss of skin integrity. At six months, there were no signs of recurrence, and at nine months, the appearance of the skin had fully returned to normal.

This is a discharge summary for a 53-year-old female who presented with diplopia, nausea, and bony tenderness. Physical exam revealed a right cranial nerve VI palsy and her workup revealed multiple myeloma.

Medical History and Hospital Course:

The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hypothyroidism. She presented with increasing diplopia and nausea for six days. The patient also experienced an unintentional weight loss of 10 pounds in the preceding two weeks. Physical exam revealed bony tenderness localized to the ribs as well as a right cranial nerve VI palsy manifesting as impaired right eye abduction. Remainder of the exam was unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest/abdomen revealed multiple osteolytic lesions in the axillary skeleton throughout the thoracolumbar vertebral bodies, and pelvic bones; a healing non-displaced fifth anterior lateral rib fracture was present on the right. CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head showed multiple bone lesions, with a well-defined lesion measuring 12 × 15 mm within the right side of the clivus adjacent to Dorello’s canal.

Hemogram with differential was remarkable for white count of 10,700 k/µL (3.7–10.3 k/µL), with absolute neutrophil count of 7.5 k/µL (1.6–6.1 k/µL). Absolute lymphocyte count was within normal limits (2.42 k/µL (1.6–6.1 k/µL)). Blood chemistry was remarkable for: serum calcium of 15.8 mg/dL (8.9–10.2 mg/dL), ionized calcium of 7.7 mg/dL (4.6–5.1 mg/dL), and glucose of 254 mg/dL (90–120 mg/dL). Parathyroid hormone was <10 pg/mL (12–72 pg/mL) and parathyroid hormone related peptide was 1.3 (normal). Urine analysis and urine protein electrophoresis was unremarkable without evidence of Bence-Jones protein. The calculated protein gap between total protein (6.8 g/dL) and serum globulin (2.8 g/dL) was 4.0 g/dL and the albumin/gamma globulin ratio was elevated at 2.4 (0.8–2.0).

Serum protein electrophoresis revealed faint monoclonal immunoglobulin. Serum immune-quantification showed IgG 1150 mg/dL (720–1598 mg/dL), IgA 200 mg/dL (75–400 mg/dL), and IgM 41 (35–225 mg/dL). Kappa light chain was 108.18 mg/L (3.30–19.4 mg/L), lambda light chain 445.32 mg/L (5.71–26.30 mg/L), with a kappa/lambda free light chain ratio of 0.24 (0.26–1.65). Bone marrow biopsy results demonstrated hypercellular bone marrow involved by plasma cell neoplasm (50–60% aberrant lambda restricted plasma cells). Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies found evidence of CCND1/IGH gene fusion and gain of chromosome 1q. Flow cytometry of bone marrow aspirate demonstrated a small population of aberrant lambda restricted plasma cells positive for CD38, CD56, moderate CD45 and Lambda, and negative for CD19.

Treatment:

The patient's hypercalcemia was treated with IV normal saline, calcitonin, and pamidronate. Pain was controlled with acetaminophen and tramadol with oxycodone for breakthrough pain. The patient was evaluated by the hematology-oncology service and received external beam radiation therapy to the clivus, alleviating her cranial nerve VI palsy. Her disease was then managed with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (CyBorD) chemotherapy. With treatment her symptoms resolved.

Follow-up:

Three months into therapy, her repeat laboratory testing demonstrated good response to treatment. The lambda light chain had decreased to 13.1 mg/L (5.71–26.30 mg/L), with a normal kappa/lambda free light chain ratio of 1.0 (0.26–1.65). Furthermore, a repeat bone marrow biopsy was obtained, which showed no morphologic evidence of multiple myeloma.",,,0

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 16-year-old Caucasian female, presented to our hospital with acute pelvic pain, nausea, vomiting, and tenderness approximately 30 hours after symptom onset. Direct abdominal X-ray images were normal, and tumor markers were within normal ranges. Preoperative abdominal US showed minimal pelvic fluid, an increase in diameter of the appendix, and a large right ovary with increased diameter relative to the left ovary, leading to the suspicion of right ovarian torsion.
During surgery, right ovarian torsion with a hemorrhagic cyst approximately 8 cm in diameter was detected. A cystectomy was performed to prevent retorsion, and the ovary was repaired. Aspiration was performed on contralateral ovarian cysts, and the appendix was deemed periappendicitis, leading to its removal. The patient had no complications during the postoperative period, and she was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Date of Admission: July 2020
Date of Discharge: [Patient is still under observation]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital in July 2020 after a chest CT scan revealed the presence of two lung lesions. The patient underwent wedge resection of these lesions a month later. Gross examination of the surgical specimens revealed an intraparenchymal, peripheral, solid, yellow-white lesion measuring 1.4 cm in greatest dimension. Histological assessment identified a well-circumscribed lesion composed of two different morphological components, tightly adhered but not intermingled each other. A final diagnosis of “combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid” was made.

Genetic testing of the tumor tissue was performed, which revealed a number of somatic mutations in each entity. The adenocarcinoma and carcinoid components of the mixed neoplasm shared the same mutations in BRAF, NF1, STK11, and AKT2 genes. Further, four additional somatic mutations were detected in the DDR2, CDK6, and SMARCA4 genes in the adenocarcinoma component, whereas no specific mutations were identified in the carcinoid component. A different genetic profile emerged from the molecular analysis of the two additional adenocarcinoma nodules, which lacked those somatic mutations identified in the mixed nodules, but shared two somatic missense mutations in the KRAS and NOTCH1 genes.

Due to ROS1 positivity observed in the upper pulmonary lobe neoplasia, the patient started crizotinib in November 2020. The patient is still receiving the treatment, and the current status of the disease is stable.

Discharge Instructions:
The patient requires regular medical follow-up and evaluation to monitor the status of the disease. The patient is advised to follow up with the oncologist at regular intervals and take the prescribed medication as instructed. The patient should also maintain good health practices, including a healthy diet, regular exercise, and stress reduction.

Conclusion:
The discharge summary indicates that the patient was admitted to the hospital and underwent wedge resection of two lung lesions. The final diagnosis was ""combined pulmonary adenocarcinoma with atypical carcinoid."" The genetic analysis revealed different somatic mutations in the different tumor entities. The patient started crizotinib due to ROS1 positivity, and the current status of the disease is stable. The patient is advised to follow medical instructions and maintain good health practices.",,,0
1978,"Hospital Course Summary:

This is a hospital course summary for a 68-year-old Japanese woman who was admitted for treatment of recurrent tumor deposits in the pelvic cavity, consistent with peritoneal dissemination and vaginal metastasis. The patient previously underwent ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection due to appendiceal cancer, which was confirmed as KRAS-mutant (codon 12) moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. The patient had undergone multiple courses of chemotherapy and surgical resection, the latest of which was performed to remove a tumor attached to the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, ileum, and right obturator lymph nodes. However, the patient developed liver metastasis, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination, which were considered unresectable. The patient subsequently received palliative care and passed away one and a half years after the last surgery.

Admission summary:

The patient was admitted to our hospital with a history of recurrent tumor deposits in the pelvic cavity, consistent with peritoneal dissemination and vaginal metastasis. The patient had undergone previous surgical resection and chemotherapy for KRAS-mutant moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the appendix. The patient was admitted under the care of the oncology team for further management.

Hospital course:

During the hospital stay, the patient underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy and subsequent surgical resection for tumor control and increased resectability. A femoro-femoral arterial bypass with a synthetic vascular graft was performed to secure the blood supply to the right lower extremities. The subsequent laparotomy revealed a fixed and solid tumor at the right inguinal fossa, involving the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, ileum, and right obturator lymph nodes. En bloc tumor resection was successfully performed, including a partial resection of the external iliac artery, external iliac vein, and ileum. The postoperative course was uneventful, except for a prolonged ileus.

Postoperative management:

The patient received FOLFIRI as adjuvant chemotherapy following the tumor resection. After six courses, a follow-up CT scan showed liver metastasis, para-aortic lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination. These recurrent lesions were considered unresectable. The chemotherapy regimen was altered to trifluridine/tipiracil. After seven courses, a follow-up CT scan showed a significant progression of the liver metastasis. Regorafenib was then administered for two weeks; however, it was discontinued because the patient denied further aggressive treatment.

Discharge summary:

The patient received palliative care and eventually passed away one and a half years after the last surgery due to the progression of the disease. The team provided supportive care and counseling to the patient and family during the course of her treatment.",,,0

Admission Diagnosis:
Widely disseminated sebaceous carcinoma including metastases to brain, visceral organs, lymph nodes, and bone.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient presented for removal of a rapidly growing nodule in the anterior abdominal wall. Two days later, he developed confusion, urinary incontinence, and progressive aphasia. Emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed 4 enhancing gray-white matter junctional lesions, and the patient underwent craniotomy and resection of bilateral frontal lobe tumors. The tumor was diagnosed as sebaceous carcinoma after a histopathologic examination. 

The patient commenced off-label treatment with pembrolizumab (2 mg/kg, every 3 weeks) in December 2016 due to strong PD-L1 expression, a moderately high tumor mutational burden, and a significant rationale for the use of checkpoint inhibitors in several other tumor types. A follow-up PET/CT scan 3 months after the initiation of anti-PD1 therapy revealed remarkable improvement in lymph nodes, lung, and soft tissue. A restaging PET/CT obtained after 6 months of treatment showed further significant improvements in all previously noted lesions. 

After 10 months of therapy, the patient developed severe fatigue and orthostatic hypotension, requiring hospitalization. Laboratory testing showed him to have secondary adrenal insufficiency and received adrenal replacement therapy with hydrocortisone (10 mg/5 mg) during high dose steroid therapy. 

Recent restaging studies demonstrate growth of the mediastinal metastases and a reduction in the size of the hepatic and small bowel metastases, suggestive of pseudoprogression and a durable ongoing response to pembrolizumab.

1222,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY:

Patient 3, a 23-year-old female with monoallelic deletion of exons 1-2 of the CDH1 gene, was admitted to our hospital for prophylactic total gastrectomy. The patient had a past medical history of generalized anxiety disorder and gastritis and a family history of cleft lip in an offspring. Her initial CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis and EGD biopsy were unremarkable. Immunohistochemical analysis of gastric and intestinal tissue revealed multiple microscopic signet ring cell foci confined to the lamina propria without evidence of invasion into the submucosa. The patient underwent successful prophylactic total gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy with j-tube placement. Following a brief hospital stay on post-operative day 7, the patient was discharged.

The patient was also offered prophylactic bilateral mastectomy due to increased incidence of LBC in women with CDH1 mutations. Initially, the patient refused the procedure citing the desire to breastfeed her future children and the low incidence of the disease prior to the age of 30. However, she subsequently consented to the procedure and underwent successful prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. During her outpatient recovery, the patient developed symptomatic gallstones. She was re-admitted for elective cholecystectomy and recovered without complications. The patient continues to follow-up with our clinic and currently displays no evidence of disease.",,,0

Reason for Admission: 
The patient was admitted due to innumerable pulmonary metastases resulted from conventional chondrosarcoma.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient was initially diagnosed with localized prostate cancer for which he underwent prostatectomy. Later, he presented with a lytic mass of the distal femur and biopsy revealed grade 2 conventional chondrosarcoma. The patient underwent resection and final pathology showed grade 3 conventional chondrosarcoma.

After nine months, the patient developed pulmonary metastases which were further confirmed by biopsy. Due to the general lack of efficacy of cytotoxic chemotherapy for conventional chondrosarcoma and the patient's inability to participate in clinical trials, treatment with nivolumab 240 mg (flat dose) intravenously every 2 weeks was initiated on a compassionate use basis. However, after 4 doses of nivolumab, the pulmonary nodules increased in size and number, and thus therapy was stopped. The patient planned to enroll in a clinical trial that was not available at our site at the time of nivolumab initiation.

Three months later, pre-trial CT scans revealed a near-complete response in his pulmonary nodules. Rather than enrolling on trial, he reinitiated nivolumab therapy and continues with improvement in his few remaining pulmonary nodules.

Genetic analysis showed a mutation in exon 4 of IDH2 and a variant of unknown significance in exon 11 of BRCA2. The tumor was microsatellite stable by sequencing and demonstrated no loss of expression of mismatch repair proteins (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) when assessed by immunohistochemistry. PTEN expression was retained. The tumor did not express PD-1 and was 1% positive (2+) for PD-L1. Tumor mutational burden was low (4 mutations/Mb).

Discharge Instructions: 
The patient has been advised to continue with nivolumab therapy as directed by his physician. He has been advised to follow up with his physician for regular evaluation and follow-up visits. The patient has been advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, including a healthy diet and regular exercise.

Patient is a 35-year-old Caucasian male with a three-month history of progressive lower back pain radiating to the left leg. Dorsal spine MRI revealed a mass involving the left ilium, sacrum, and left sacroiliac joint. Biopsy of the mass showed a small round blue cell malignant neoplasm. He was diagnosed with primary localized ES. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy according to the VIVA regimen. He completed radiotherapy to the primary site and all planned treatment in January 2013. The patient was under close follow-up, and in May of 2014, he presented with multiple lung and two pleural lesions. Biopsy confirmed the lesions to be a relapse of ES with metastasis to lungs. The patient received five cycles of topotecan and cyclophosphamide. A follow-up CT of the chest in July 2014, before cycle 3, showed interval decrease in the metastatic lesions, consistent with chemosensitive disease. A PET/CT scan during August 2014, after five cycles of topotecan/cyclophosphamide, showed stable metastatic disease in the form of pulmonary nodules and pleural involvement. Autologous stem cells were collected during a single leukapheresis session before the first high-dose chemotherapy (HDCT). The patient received two rounds of planned consolidative high-dose chemotherapy. HDCT achieved 12 months of progression-free survival (PFS); however, on a subsequent PET scan performed during October 2015, the patient showed disease progression.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of lower abdominal pain and inability to pass urine. On evaluation, a huge mass was found arising from the cervix and occupying the whole pelvis. An ultrasound and MRI pelvis revealed a mass of 15 cm × 15 cm with typical whorled appearance which was arising from the cervix and lower uterine body. The uterus was normal sized and was placed just above the cervical fibroid giving it a typical “Lantern of St Paul’s dome” appearance. The patient also had mild bilateral hydroureters and hydronephrosis. Her kidney function test and urine analysis were unremarkable. Urine culture didn’t show any growth.

In view of the complication of obstructive uropathy due to huge cervical fibroid & her parity, the patient underwent abdominal myomectomy. On laparotomy, a large central cervical fibroid measuring 15 cm x 15 cm x 9 cm was seen impacted in the pelvis and displacing the uterus upwards. After careful delineation of the surrounding structures and bladder dissection, successful intra-capsular enucleation of cervical fibroid was done. There were no intra-operative complications and the patient stood the surgery well.

Patient MDX245, a 48-year-old female with low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma and bilateral pulmonary metastases, was admitted to our hospital for treatment. She underwent laparoscopic surgery and was started on a chemotherapy regimen including lobaplatin, doxorubicin and ifosfamide. However, after only 2 cycles of chemotherapy, her disease progressed in the lungs and severe myelosuppression developed.

The patient underwent clinical investigation and was found to be a candidate for apatinib therapy based on her condition. The results of MiniPDX tests showed that the lung metastases responded well to apatinib as a single agent and in combination with olapanib, but not to metformin, pazopanib or combination of pazopanib with olapanib. After 4 months of treatment, the patient achieved partial regression in her lung metastases that lasted for 8 months.

The patient was monitored and currently being followed up. The hospital course was complicated by metastatic disease and myelosuppression. However, the patient's symptoms improved with apatinib therapy. Appropriate discharge instructions were provided to the patient.

Diagnosis: Low grade endometrial stromal sarcoma with bilateral pulmonary metastases.

Treatment: Laparoscopic surgery and chemotherapy with lobaplatin, doxorubicin and ifosfamide were initiated. Apatinib therapy was given based on the patient's clinical investigation and MiniPDX test results.

The 69-year-old male patient was admitted with dyspnea, relapsing dizziness, falls, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome. Lab values showed an elevated white blood count, a high level of C-reactive protein, and elevated INR without anticoagulant medication. CT of the chest revealed right lower lobe pneumonia. During the hospital stay, the patient experienced mild abdominal symptoms and a decrease in hemoglobin level. An abdominal CT showed a moderate-sized haemoperitoneum, particular in the upper abdomen, and SAM of the left omental artery was suspected. Fresh frozen plasma and erythrocyte concentrates were given, but hemoglobin levels continued to decrease. Catheter angiography was performed, and the aneurysm of the left omental artery was identified as the cause of the haemoperitoneum. Superselective catheterization of the LOA through splenic artery and lower pole splenic artery with a microcatheter was successfully performed. N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate was used to embolize the LOA, and the final DSA control confirmed successful embolization of the aneurysm with preservation of the splenic vessels.

481,"Medical History:
A six-year-old female boxer dog with a 13-month history of progressive and mildly pruritic skin lesions.

Admission Exam:
Physical examination of the dog revealed no abnormalities. On dermatological examination, nine ulcerated and nonulcerated skin nodules were observed, ranged from 1 to 7 cm in diameter, and distributed mainly over bony prominences of distal extremities and digits of the front legs, left elbow, and right hock. Other skin lesions included footpad hyperkeratosis, crusting, depigmentation, and erosions.

Diagnostic Tests:
Fine needle aspiration (FNA) cytology made from material obtained from nonulcerated skin nodules revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation and numerous mainly extracellular round-shaped organisms, ranging from 20 to 30 μm in diameter, most containing 2 spores of approximately 10 μm in diameter. A culture of FNA material in dermatophyte test medium (DTM) was performed, and smooth, creamy, yeast-like colonies were grown. Histopathology revealed nodular-to-diffuse, pyogranulomatous dermatitis and panniculitis.

Diagnosis:
Cutaneous protothecosis due to Prototheca wickerhamii was confirmed through sequencing of a portion of the 28S rRNA gene following DNA isolation.

Treatment:
The patient was treated with oral fluconazole, which resulted in significant clinical improvement in footpad lesions after one month of administration. However, the progression of skin nodules was not slowed with this treatment regimen. A protocol developed to treat canine cryptococcosis was then applied, which involved subcutaneous infusion of AMB and concurrent administration of itraconazole. Due to nephrotoxicity, AMB was discontinued after seven infusions, and the patient is presently receiving itraconazole alone.

502,"Discharge Summary:

Patient was a 30-year old pregnant woman who presented with left lower quadrant discomfort during her second month of pregnancy. A mixed cystic and solid left adnexal mass measuring 8.6 × 6.7 × 8.3 cm was discovered during an ultrasound examination. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed early in the second trimester. Grossly, an intact 7.5 cm complex cystic-solid mass with nearly half involved by a friable, tan-yellow tumor with papillary excrescences, some of which were freely floating within the cyst cavity was noted. Histologic sections revealed a struma ovarii with over 50% characterized by the classic features of a well-differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma. The periphery of the tumor impinged on the ovarian capsule and vascular structures, but no definitive evidence of invasion was found on the histologic sections reviewed. Ovarian mature cystic teratoma was also present in other areas of the tumor.

The patient’s tumor expressed positive immunohistochemical staining for thyroglobulin (Tg) and thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF1), but was negative for BRAF V600E. Serum Tg was found to be elevated after surgical removal of the ovarian mass, which is reasonably expected given the proximity to surgery and the known increase in Tg levels during pregnancy. Thyroid function tests and thyroid ultrasound were normal. Levothyroxine (L-T4) was initiated to suppress thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).

After delivery, the patient underwent total thyroidectomy to permit evaluation for metastatic disease and monitoring for recurrence by Tg levels. Thyroid pathology was benign. Several months after delivery, cessation of lactation and L-T4 withdrawal resulted in an unexpected rise in Tg levels. A concurrent diagnostic I-131 scan was performed with planar and SPECT/CT imaging. The scan revealed focal central neck activity consistent with thyroid remnant and the presence of iodine-avid skeletal metastatic disease involving the left ninth rib, bilateral proximal femurs and sacrum. High-quality SPECT/CT images eliminated the need for separate dedicated CT and bone scan. The patient was treated with TSH suppression resulting in an undetectable Tg level.

Follow-up evaluations demonstrated a stimulated Tg level and negative diagnostic I-131 scan without focal abnormal radioiodine uptake in the neck or skeleton. A 100 mCi I-131 therapeutic challenge was performed to eliminate any microscopic residual disease and more accurately ascertain the treatment response. The post-therapy I-131 scan demonstrated complete resolution of pulmonary metastatic disease. Faint residual foci of activity were demonstrated in the left ninth rib, sacrum, and left proximal femur, consistent with a partial therapeutic response in the skeleton.

The patient continues to do well, being conservatively managed with active clinical and biochemical monitoring during L-T4 suppression therapy.",,,0

The patient's parents reported increased appetite at two months of age, with subsequent rapid weight gain to 15 kg at six months of age. Physical examination revealed generalized body fat distribution, a rounded face, and deep skinfolds. Laboratory investigations revealed normal routine hematological and biochemical parameters ruling out diabetes, except for serum liver aminotransferases. Abdominal ultrasound showed normal morphology of kidneys and features of hepatic steatosis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed no abnormality. Genetic testing revealed a homozygous missense mutation in exon 3 of the LEP gene resulting in the amino acid substitution of asparagine for aspartic acid at codon 100. The patient was diagnosed with monogenic obesity due to LEP gene mutation.

Patient n.1 is a 66-year-old male with diabetes type I, associated diabetic retinopathy, and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). The patient presented with increasing irritating symptoms of eye discomfort, described as burning, itchiness, and feeling sand in his eyes, scored as OSDI (Ocular Surface Disease Index) of 65 out of 100, with a VAS (Visual Analogue Score) score of pain of 74 mm out of 100 and no difference between eyes. After being unsuccessfully treated with standard tear substitutes, a compassionate unconventional therapy with CBS eye drops was administered for two months.

A significant relief from subjective symptoms of discomfort, such as burning, itchiness, and feeling sand in his eyes, was reported in September 2016. OSDI score and VAS score were significantly reduced. The visual field tests performed since 2014 were analyzed and showed a significant lowering in MD values followed by an amelioration in association with the period of treatment with CBS. An amelioration of the defect was observed in all the four quadrants in both eyes.

In conclusion, CBS eye drops therapy seems to have reduced symptoms in a patient who was unable to alleviate them with traditional treatments. Further studies or reports may be warranted to investigate the potential for CBS eye drops as a treatment for ocular surface discomfort, but these initial results suggest a promising alternative therapy.",,,0

Chief complaint: Large liver mass detected by an abdominal CT scan

Hospital Course:

The patient was transferred to our Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Clinic for the evaluation of a large liver mass detected by an abdominal CT scan in an outside hospital. Physical examination revealed a palpable liver edge of 6 cm below the right costal margin with no abdominal tenderness or guarding. Initial laboratory investigations indicated slightly elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Further imaging studies, including ultrasonography and MRI of the abdomen, confirmed the presence of a hepatic mass with multiple internal cystic foci and peripheral neovascular formation in the right hepatic lobe. Extended right hepatectomy was performed, and a pathological diagnosis of undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver (UESL) was made. Postoperative PET scan did not reveal residual or metastatic disease, and the patient received a five-month course of chemotherapy with VAdrC/VIE including vincristine, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, ifosfamide, and etoposide.

At 48 months of follow-up, surveillance MRI showed a hyperintense, 7 mm lung lesion on T2-weighted images, but PET scan was negative. Chest CT imaging at 50 months following the hepatectomy revealed a 1.7 × 1.4 cm lung nodule in the left lower lobe with no pleural or pericardial effusions. The patient underwent lateral thoracotomy with wedge resection of the left lower lobe nodule. The pathological findings were consistent with metastases of the UESL. A chemotherapy regimen with olaratumab plus doxorubicin was received. The patient is currently nine months after wedge resection and remains well with no evidence of tumor recurrence.

A 64-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of acquired factor X (FX) deficiency from amyloid light-chain (AL) amyloidosis, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF), metastatic lung adenocarcinoma, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), hypertension, and t2dm was admitted to the hematology clinic for routine follow-up. The initial outpatient laboratory findings showed coagulation profile abnormalities and elevated alkaline phosphatase and creatinine levels. Proteinuria was also detected, and abdominal ultrasound revealed hepatomegaly. Abdominal fat pad biopsy was unrevealing, but the liver biopsy confirmed extensive amyloid deposition, with immunohistochemical staining revealing lambda light chain. A bone marrow core biopsy showed extensive amyloid deposition and was positive for Congo red staining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was positive for lambda light chains, and a diagnosis of acquired FX deficiency secondary to AL amyloidosis was made. In 2015, she developed symptomatic PAF, and her coagulation profile showed abnormalities with a significant risk for thromboembolism. Therefore, she was started on apixaban 5 mg twice daily with close outpatient follow-up. Three months later, she underwent open reduction and internal fixation of the left hip, with enoxaparin 30 mg subcutaneously every 12 hours started for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis. Two weeks postoperatively, she was restarted on her usual dose of apixaban for her paroxysmal AF.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted with a 10-day history of painful, cyanosis, and progressive digital necrosis in both hands. Additionally, the patient had previously noticed a painless mass in the right axillary gap, drenching night sweats, and 5 kg weight loss.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, physical examination revealed necrotic lesions on the distal phalanges of both hands (except the thumbs), enlarged lymph nodes in the right axillary (3 cm) and right supraclavicular gaps (4 cm), and all pulses were palpable. The computed tomographic scan evidenced right axillary adenopathic conglomerate (6 cm), right supraclavicular gap (5 cm), and multiple retroperitoneal adenopathies (<10 cm). Further investigations showed normal electrolytes, liver function, lipidic profile, and serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP). Coagulation tests, serum complement levels, and serologic tests for rheumatoid factor, antinuclear, antineutrophil-cytoplasmatic, lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin, anti-B2 glycoprotein 1, cryoglobulins, and cryoagglutinins were negative. Human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B and C viruses were negative as well. Arteriography of upper limbs demonstrated a distal stop in all bilateral digital arteries. Transthoracic echocardiogram was normal.
Due to digital ischemia interpreted as a paraneoplastic phenomenon, the patient was treated with corticosteroids (hydrocortisone 200 mg every 8 hours) and a bolus of 1g intravenous cyclophosphamide. There was a significant decline in pain, cyanosis, and progression of ischemic lesions after 6 days of treatment, but amputation of three phalanges was required due to necrosis. During the surgery, there was no delay in healing due to acrosyndrome. Biopsy of axillary nodes demonstrated nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Classical HL stage IIIb was confirmed.
The patient started conventional ABVD protocol (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine) which was well-tolerated. After 6 cycles, the patient remained asymptomatic, and symptoms of digital ischemia were completely resolved. At the end of treatment, positron emission tomography/computed tomography was negative, confirming complete remission of HL. Follow-up was performed monthly during 6 months and then every 3 months. After 18 months, the patient remains in remission of HL, with no evidence of digital ischemia recurrence.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Digital ischemia, interpreted as a paraneoplastic phenomenon secondary to nodular sclerosis classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Amputation of three phalanges was required. The patient is in remission of HL after completing 6 cycles of conventional ABVD protocol.

Hospital Day 1:
A 31-year-old African-American female presented to the emergency department with sudden onset severe headaches, highly suggestive of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). A neurological examination revealed no deficits.

Hospital Day 2:
Computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a SAH filling pre-pontine, crural, ambient, and quadrigeminal cisterns more prominently on the left side of the brain, with mild hydrocephalus. A CT-angiography (CTA) showed an enlarged vessel within the left ambient cistern. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed a large and irregular appearance of the left SCA in the ambient cistern. No immediate intervention was undertaken.

Hospital Day 14:
Patient remained stable in the neurosurgical intensive care unit with regular neurological examinations and daily transcranial-doppler (TCD) studies. TCD values showed only moderate vasospasm. The patient did not require any treatment for the mild radiographic hydrocephalus. On Day 14, the patient underwent a repeat DSA which showed a persistent vasospasm in the distal basilar and bilateral posterior cerebral arteries. 3-D reformatting also demonstrated a dissecting fusiform SCA aneurysm in the lateral ponto-mesencephalic segment. No intervention was undertaken at that time.

Hospital Day 21:
The patient underwent a successful endovascular procedure where a low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS Jr.) device was placed, covering the fusiform aneurysm measuring 3-mm wide and 18-mm in length. The intervention aimed to preserve the intraluminal flow with flow diversion from the aneurysm for reduction and eventual obliteration.

Hospital Day 90:
At the 3-month follow-up, the patient remained neurologically stable with no complaints. A CTA showed the SCA patency proximal and distal to the stent without evidence of persistent dilatation or an aneurysm.

Hospital Day 300:
At the 10-month follow-up, a DSA demonstrated the interval healing of the aneurysm with preserved vessel patency as well as mild distortion caused by the stent in the SCA. The patient remained neurologically stable with no complaints.

Final Diagnosis:
Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) due to a dissecting fusiform SCA aneurysm in the lateral ponto-mesencephalic segment.

Interventions/Procedures:
Placement of a low-profile visualized intraluminal support (LVIS Jr.) device covering the fusiform aneurysm.

History of Present Illness: [Name] presented to the office with fractured central incisors. He had partial edentulism in the superior left quadrant and multiple decay and fractured teeth. He was at high risk for caries and eccentric bruxism. The initial approach was conservative aiming to keep the upper front by means of composite fillings. Multiple restorations and implants were placed over the course of several years. In 2017, the patient came back to the office referring to pain of endodontic origin in the upper left canine. Subgingival caries in the six front teeth were found which made prognosis poor. The patient opted for replacement of residual teeth with a new implant-supported bridge.

Hospital Course: The treatment was carried out in a staged approach. The lateral incisors were extracted, and two immediate implants were placed by employing the Socket Shield Technique (SST). Four residual teeth were then prepared to be used as abutments of a temporary bridge for the duration of early osseointegration. After osseointegration, the second provisional bridge was cemented onto the uncovered implants. Three months after, the implants were uncovered, and the four abutment teeth were extracted again with the SST. The first provisional was replaced by a second acrylic bridge screwed onto the implants through temporary abutments. One month later, the prosthodontic phase was undertaken before the definitive prosthesis was placed.

Diagnosis: Fractured central incisors, eccentric bruxism, subgingival caries

Treatment: The patient was treated with the SST. Conservative approaches, composite fillings, implant restorations, and prostheses were performed. The patient had root canal treatment, and the implants were covered by healing abutments. The definitive prosthesis was placed after five months.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital following 2 days of lightheadedness, abdominal pain, and melena. He had a past medical history of hypertension and erosive gastritis that required transfusion. Two weeks prior at a nearby academic medical center, he was diagnosed with an unidentified mass at the head of the pancreas and prescribed prednisone 20 mg PO b.i.d. Along with diltiazem and tramadol, the patient was compliant with his medications. Upon arrival, the patient was hypertensive with a blood pressure of 175/39 mm Hg and a pulse of 140. On examination, the patient was found to have significant epigastric tenderness without rebound. Melena was also present during rectal examination. Diagnostic tests revealed leukocytosis, a reduced hemoglobin level, and significantly elevated platelets. The patient received fluid resuscitation after becoming hypotensive during hospital day 1. The hemoglobin level subsequently decreased from 9.2 to 7.8 mg/dL. The patient's steroid therapy was discontinued due to concerns about diagnostic clarity and veracity of the AIP diagnosis in the setting of gastrointestinal bleeding.

During hospital day 2, the patient continued to experience abdominal pain and had another episode of melena that required transfusion without vital sign abnormalities. Diagnostic tests showed a reduction in leukocyte count and platelets as a result of discontinuation of steroid therapy. He underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) on hospital day 3, which revealed multiple erosions and an ulcer in the duodenal bulb, erosive gastritis in various regions of the stomach, and grade 2+ gastric varices and grade 1+ nonbleeding varices in the esophagus. Ultrasound with Doppler studies showed moderate splenic enlargement but patency of the splenic, hepatic, and portal veins. Melena persisted throughout hospital days 4 to 7, and the patient was discharged on hospital day 7, tolerating a full diet, and started on a suite of medications including pantoprazole, prednisone 20 mg PO b.i.d., propranolol, sucralfate, and tramadol which was to be taken as required for abdominal pain.

Final Diagnosis:
The patient presented with lightheadedness, abdominal pain, and melena. Diagnostic testing revealed leukocytosis, reduced hemoglobin levels, and significantly elevated platelet counts. His previous AIP diagnosis was being reassessed due to gastrointestinal bleeding.

A 74-year-old male presented to the emergency department with complaints of tenderness and swelling of the left knee. The patient had a past history of hypertension, spinal stenosis, benign prostate hypertrophy, and unruptured aneurysm of the right carotid artery. The initial physical examination revealed tenderness and crepitus of the left knee, and radiographs confirmed the diagnosis of supracondylar fracture of the left distal femur. The patient underwent a successful closed reduction and retrograde intramedullary nailing of the fractured joint the following day.

Progress Note:
On postoperative day 7, the patient complained of general weakness, nausea, vomiting, and anorexia. On postoperative day 9, the hemoglobin level decreased to 8.2 g/dL and on postoperative day 10, the patient's right distal femur fractured when rising from a wheelchair. Further evaluation revealed persistent hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions.

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to the endocrinology department for evaluation of hypercalcemia. The workup revealed an elevated serum intact parathyroid hormone level and serum 25(OH)D level. A workup for anemia was concurrently carried out, revealing an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level and β2-microglobulin levels. Due to the combination of persistent hypercalcemia, renal failure, anemia, and bone lesions, serum and urine electrophoresis were performed to rule out the possibility of multiple myeloma, both which were negative.

Progress Note:
To exclude hematologic malignancy, a bone marrow biopsy at the left iliac crest was performed. Bone marrow pathology revealed atypical lymphocytes that stained positive for the CD20 marker, which is consistent with B-cell lymphoma (BCL) involving the bone marrow. Immunophenotyping of bone marrow cells further supported the diagnosis of BCL, with the population testing positive for CD45, CD19, CD20, CD79a, and HLA-DR. 

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent a complete diagnostic workup to find any hidden malignancy. A thin-slice chest CT and abdominopelvic CT scans were unremarkable. Additionally, a torso PET-CT scan showed no abnormal FDG uptake. The patient was diagnosed with a rare case of primary bone marrow DLBCL.

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with respiratory symptoms, and a CT scan revealed the presence of multiple metastatic lesions.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 43-year-old female, was admitted to the hospital in August 2008, following a diagnosis of infiltrating canalicular carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. She underwent a partial mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection and subsequently received adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Hormonal therapy was initiated following completion of chemotherapy. Six years after the initial diagnosis, the patient was admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms, and a CT scan revealed the presence of multiple metastatic lesions. A PET/CT scan was performed to evaluate the extent of these lesions.

Imaging and Laboratory Findings:
The PET/CT scan revealed increased 18F-FDG uptake in the lungs, bones, and axillary lymph nodes. The largest pulmonary nodule (17 mm) localized at the posterior basal segment of the left lower lobe showed an SUVmax value of 10.7. A mediastinal lymph node had an SUVmax of 3.9. Subsequent imaging studies were conducted using 68Ga-DTPA anti-HER2 and 18F-16α-17β-fluoroestradiol (18F-FES), and metastatic tumours of the lungs and lymph nodes were visualized with both radiotracers.

Biopsy Results:
Biopsy specimens were obtained from the metastatic lesions exhibiting the highest uptake to confirm the HER2 overexpression. Immunohistochemical examination revealed positive staining for hormone receptors in the breast, lymph node and lung, whereas HER2 was negative in the breast and indeterminate (2+) in both metastatic sites. However, using fluorescence microscopy and in situ hybridization (FISH), HER2 overexpression was confirmed in the lymph node as well as in the lung, whereas the primary tumour remained negative.

Summary:
The patient, a female, was admitted to the hospital with metastatic breast cancer, following a past history of infiltrating canalicular carcinoma.

Diagnosis: B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (B-PLL)

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the clinic for evaluation of anemia and thrombocytopenia. The physical examination revealed massive splenomegaly, but no hepatomegaly or lymphadenopathy. The peripheral smear showed abundant prolymphocytes. The bone marrow aspirate and biopsy revealed a marrow that was diffusely infiltrated by atypical, homogenous lymphocytes with medium to large size moderately condensed chromatin and prominent nucleoli. The B-cell prolymphocytic leukemia was diagnosed according to the bone marrow pathology and immunophenotype results, which was consistent with the diagnosis.

After starting treatment with rituximab and bendamustine, the patient experienced recurrent infusion reactions with rituximab, which worsened with every treatment. Therefore, the treatment was switched to a combination of obinutuzumab and chlorambucil. After 4 cycles of obinutuzumab-chlorambucil, the patient had gained weight with improved appetite and energy level. On physical examination, the spleen was no longer palpable. A repeat posttreatment PET scan showed a decreased spleen size, which measured approximately 18.5 × 10.0 × 7.3 cm, and her lymphadenopathy and pleural effusions had resolved. She also had an improvement in her anemia and thrombocytopenia after the treatment with normalization of the lymphocyte count. Prolymphocytes were no longer noted on the peripheral smear. The patient achieved a clinical partial remission and was then placed on maintenance obinutuzumab 1000 mg monotherapy every 2 months. No major adverse events occurred during her treatment with obinutuzumab and chlorambucil or while on monotherapy with obinutuzumab.

The patient was discharged with good medical condition after the treatment. However, she was closely monitored for any signs of disease progression while being switched to surveillance.

Diagnosis: Renal Oncocytoma

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted for postoperative follow-up management after receiving a renal allograft from a deceased  donor. During the routine examination, a 2.4-cm lesion was serendipitously discovered on the upper pole of the renal allograft. Biopsy confirmed the lesion to be consistent with a renal oncocytoma. The eosinophilic variant of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma was ruled out following negative immunohistochemical staining.

Treatment and Care Plan:

Given the low risk of malignant transformation in an oncocytoma, the decision was made to monitor the tumor with active surveillance. The patient received mycophenolate-mofetil, tacrolimus, and prednisone throughout the 5-year follow-up period, and the regimen for immunosuppression was not changed despite the presence of the renal mass. The patient underwent ultrasonography every 2 months for the first year, followed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) every year. The renal oncocytoma displayed no growth, regression, or any other interim morphological changes.

Patient Outcome:

After 60 months of active surveillance, radiological studies have shown no growth, regression, or any other morphological changes to the renal oncocytoma. The patient is alive and well. 

Recommendations:

The patient should continue to undergo annual MRI monitoring to ensure that the tumor remains stable. In case of any changes, further evaluation and treatment will be advised.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The patient, an 83-year-old male with a history of chronic hepatitis, was admitted to the hospital for evaluation of a hepatic mass found on abdominal imaging, which was subsequently diagnosed as hepatocellular carcinoma by ultrasound-guided biopsy. Transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation of the mass was performed. The patient had mild encephalopathy and hyperammonemia at the time of treatment, which worsened after the procedure, and continued after treatment of the hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was treated with amino acid solution and lactulose, but hyperammonemia did not improve. Therefore, transcatheter embolisation of the PV shunt was planned. The patient underwent a selective embolisation of one pathway of the PV shunt with detachable coils under flow control using a balloon catheter. However, embolisation of the other pathway could not be performed due to the patient's hepatic encephalopathy.

The patient was then scheduled for right hepatic vein embolisation using an AVP II. The procedural time was 135 minutes. Following the procedure, the patient's serum ammonia level decreased, and hepatic encephalopathy improved. The patient was monitored carefully, and no complications were noted. The patient was discharged in stable condition with no further recommendations for hospital care.

Summary:
The patient, an 83-year-old male with hepatocellular carcinoma and a PV shunt, underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolisation of the mass with subsequent development of hyperammonemia and mild encephalopathy. Transcatheter embolisation of the PV shunt was performed, along with right hepatic vein embolisation using an AVP II.

The patient presented with a large perineal mass that was first discovered 30 years ago. The mass suddenly started to grow and caused discomfort in the perineum. Upon physical examination, an approximately 15-cm cystic mass was observed in the left perineum near the anus. Ulceration or discharge was not observed. A colonoscopy was performed, but no significant findings were observed.

The patient underwent excision surgery, and a cystic mass with sebum and keratin was identified in the left perineum. The surgery was performed without any major complications, and the patient was discharged 2 days after the surgery.

Histopathological analysis showed the cyst had a thin wall composed of benign squamous epithelium, and some sections of the wall were thick, indicating a microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma (pTisN0M0, pStage0).

Follow-up examinations were performed every 6 months, and at 3 years postoperatively, the patient showed no evidence of recurrence.

Date of Admission: XX/XX/XXXX
Date of Discharge: XX/XX/XXXX

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 54-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension was admitted to the hospital with a high fever and right hypochondriac pain. Upon investigation, a diagnosis of liver abscess was made, which was managed by immediately performing a percutaneous puncture with drainage. Further laboratory evaluation found poor liver function and very high levels of Alpha-Fetoprotein (AFP), Protein Induced by Vitamin K Absence or Antagonist-II (PIVKA-II), and AFP-L3. A diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with triple-positive tumor marker status was made, indicating highly malignant disease. The patient also had a portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT) in the right posterior branch of the portal vein. 

The patient was treated with chemoembolization using a Hepatic Arterial Infusion of Cisplatin and 5-FU, followed by a combination of cisplatin and mitomycin C. After the first round of chemoembolization, the patient showed incomplete lipiodol accumulation within the tumor, and the PVTT progressed to the right main portal vein. Subsequently, surgical PVL was done to avoid involvement of the left portal vein. Three disseminated peritoneally nodules were also removed, and three additional rounds of transient chemoembolization were performed after the initial surgical procedure.

The patient showed marked improvement upon the fourth chemoembolization, with the tumors responding to the treatment and showing a significant reduction in size without enhancement. The patient also did not have any new tumors in the liver, and the tumor markers returned to their normal levels. A suspicious lesion that recurred 15 months after the initial treatment was treated with percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, which led to complete remission.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with HCC with macroscopic PVTT, triple-positive tumor marker status, and peritoneal dissemination.

Condition at the Time of Discharge:
The patient is currently in complete remission and has shown marked improvement in liver function. The patient has been advised to continue with regular follow-up appointments for long-term monitoring.

Reason for admission: Abdominal pain, increasing abdominal distention, and inability to pass flatus or bowel movements.

Hospital Course:

The patient was an 86-year-old male with a past medical history significant for IgG lambda light chain multiple myeloma, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. He presented to the hospital with anorexia, rigors, and severe watery diarrhea for several days after the completion of his second cycle of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma. On physical examination, he was found to have a mildly tender, tympanitic abdomen without peritoneal signs.

Laboratory examination revealed leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated creatinine, and elevated lactic acid. Noncontrast abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed diffuse colonic distension, distended fluid-filled distal small bowel loops, and innumerable small submucosal lesions covering the surface of the colon. Stool tests for infections were negative.

Initially, the diagnosis of bortezomib-induced ileus was entertained, but was later ruled out, as the patient's diarrhea resumed once he had been fluid resuscitated. The patient was diagnosed with pneumatosis coli, confirmed by repeat CT scan and colonoscopy. Biopsies of the lesions were obtained and sent for pathological evaluation, which revealed the presence of gastrointestinal amyloidosis.

The patient was treated with antidiarrheal agents and received continued treatment directed towards his multiple myeloma, which was thought to have caused the amyloidosis. He had a dramatic response to chemotherapy with resolution of his gastrointestinal symptoms.

Patient:
A 71-year-old Qatari male

Diagnosis:
Oral cavity Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)
Stage cT4 N0 M0

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital on the 12th of January 2017 for a second-line treatment with nivolumab. The treatment was started after declining chemotherapy due to post-radiation necrosis and neck fistula experienced in previous treatments.

Tests and Investigations:
Two CT scans of the patient neck were taken before treatment and 10 days after the fifth cycle of the treatment. PET CT scan was carried out 239 days after the fifth cycle (7 months, 25 days) of treatment. The antibody response to the NY-ESO-1 antigen was measured in the plasma using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against a known immunogenic NY-ESO-1 peptide. The cellular response to the NY-ESO-1 antigen was investigated in patient’s peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay for interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) production by T cells against the NY-ESO-1 overlapping peptides. Flow cytometry was used to determine the expression of PD-1 in the patient CD3+ T cells before and after nivolumab treatment. A panel of 27 plasma biomarkers (cytokines and chemokines) was analyzed by multiplex analysis.

Medical History:
The patient was diagnosed with oral HNSCC and underwent radiotherapy in London, UK in 1997 with a recurrence of the cancer in 2016 involving the supraglottic region and tongue base.

Clinical Findings:
After the fifth cycle of nivolumab treatment, the patient’s bleeding stopped and CT scan follow-up showed stable disease, no progression, or distant metastasis. PET CT scan showed a mild increase in size which suggests pseudo-progression. However, patient's condition deteriorated within time with the development of cough, blood discharge and the soft tissue mass in the neck was also observed on visits.

Laboratory Results:
ELISA results showed that the NY-ESO-1 antibody levels significantly reduce after treatment as well there was a significant decrease in IFN-γ secretion at progression.

Management and Treatment:
The patient was treated with nivolumab after declining chemotherapy. However, due to non-compliance the patient refused further treatment after the fifth cycle.

Summary:
The 71-year-old Qatari male patient was admitted for second-line treatment with nivolumab after declining chemotherapy due to post-radiation necrosis and neck fistula. After fifth cycle of nivolumab treatment, CT scan follow-up showed stable disease with no progression. However, patient's condition deteriorated with development of cough, blood discharge and soft tissue mass in the neck was observed.

Patient: 82-year-old male with HCC and PVTT

Admission Date: [Date]

Discharge Date: [Date]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our department for the surgical treatment of HCC with PVTT invasion. Due to overwhelming PVTT extensions, old age, and poor performance status, the patient was not a surgical candidate and received a combination treatment of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab with radiotherapy for PVTT.

During preparation for radiotherapy, the patient developed anal pain and persistent fever, and CT showed perianal abscess due to anal fistula. The patient recovered soon after percutaneous abscess drainage but the adverse event interrupted atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, and radiotherapy could not be introduced.

Abdominal CT showed size reduction of the main tumor and PVTT, with a reduction in tumor enhancement on contrast-enhanced CT. Serum AFP levels decreased from 90,700 ng/mL before treatment to 18,371 ng/mL and 6301 ng/mL 3 and 5 weeks after atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment, respectively. The patient continued the atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment after creating colostomy, performed 47 days after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab.

Subsequently, beginning from the 83rd day after the first administration of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab, the patient received atezolizumab monotherapy. The reason for choosing atezolizumab monotherapy was that the bleeding from the colostomy persisted from the collateral blood circulation due to the liver cirrhosis. The patient received a one-time atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment and continued with atezolizumab monotherapy afterward (9 regimens administered until now); there is no apparent sign of residual tumors at 9 months after the introduction of atezolizumab plus bevacizumab treatment.

- Adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted for evaluation of two episodes of melena within one day. He had a past medical history significant for COPD, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, coronary artery disease, dementia, and a recent large left MCA stroke that led to aphasia and residual right hemiparesis. A year ago, he was admitted for evaluation of hematemesis with a hemoglobin level of 6.9 g/dL, and EGD had shown a large submucosal, ulcerated mass in the area of major duodenal papilla with histology suggestive of benign small intestinal mucosa without any atypical changes. A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis confirmed a 6.7 cm x 5.5 cm mass at the pancreatic head invading the duodenum, leading to a pancreatic duct dilatation of 11 mm seen as a cut-off sign on CT. Examination on this admission revealed an ill-appearing, aphasic, thin male with hypotension and tachycardia. A fungating, polypoid mass was seen within the ampulla of Vater with blood oozing out of the duodenal papilla that failed to be controlled with epinephrine injection. A hypervascular mass was also seen within the second part of the duodenum and pancreatic head. A biopsy specimen taken during endoscopy showed ‘invasive adenocarcinoma’ on histopathology. Based on the clinical picture, imaging, and pathology data, the patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for elective left and right heart catheterization as a pre-transplant evaluation. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed an occlusive thrombus of the IVC that extended from the renal veins to the level of the cavoatrial junction. Thrombus was also observed in the portal vein, and multiple subcutaneous varicosities were found. Due to the patient’s history of advanced cirrhosis and large esophageal varices, anticoagulation was not an option. Palliative stenting of the IVC was performed to relieve the patient’s pain and improve his quality of life.

The 50-year-old female patient with a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery performed six years ago presented with epigastric pain, nausea, and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding of nine months duration. Despite multiple upper and lower GI endoscopies, and a video capsule endoscopy, the source of her bleeding remained unidentified. CT scan of the abdomen showed an obstructing mass at the pylorus with marked distention of the gastric remnant and a small soft tissue nodule suspicious for peritoneal metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography (PET)/CT imaging further demonstrated hypermetabolism within the gastric pylorus mass, but no evidence of metastatic disease. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) revealed wall thickening of the excluded stomach at the antrum, and two enlarged lymph nodes. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lymph nodes and the gastric wall of the excluded stomach revealed poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. The biopsy did not detect H. pylori infection, and molecular analysis showed a HER2-negative tumor. Staging laparoscopy confirmed peritoneal implants. The patient is undergoing chemotherapy for Stage IV gastric cancer with capecitabine, plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX).

Summary of Findings:
The patient's condition is significant for bleeding of the gastrointestinal tract, attributed to recurrent obstruction caused by poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. Abdominal CT scan and PET/CT imaging showed an obstructing soft tissue mass in the pylorus with fluid-filled gastric remnant distention and a small suspicious soft tissue nodule anterior to the gastric antrum. EUS detected diffuse wall thickening of the excluded stomach at the antrum and two enlarged lymph nodes. FNA biopsy of the lymph nodes and the gastric wall of the excluded stomach revealed poorly differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. The biopsy did not detect H. pylori infection, and molecular analysis showed a HER2-negative tumor. The patient underwent staging laparoscopy which confirmed peritoneal implants.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 48-year-old male with a history of syphilis and sickle cell trait, was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma with multiple lymphomatous polyposis. The patient underwent three cycles of R-Maxi CHOP and three cycles of R-High Dose-Ara-C with complete response. His PBSC were mobilized and harvested on his last cycle of R-High Dose Ara-C with G-CSF and plerixafor. Seven months after his diagnosis and two months after his last chemoimmunotherapy, he underwent the BeEAM protocol for an autologous HCT.

On day –8, the patient started the BeEAM protocol and received his first dose of intravenous bendamustine. From day –6, the patient's urine output, serum sodium, and serum creatinine started to increase. Forced diuresis with furosemide was stopped, and oral hydration was optimized. On day –1, the patient started complaining of polyuria, nocturia, and thirst. Despite the normal range of urine osmolality, a nephrology consultation team suspected nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) along with concomitant dehydration in absence of other identified causes of polyuria. A desmopressin challenge was administered intravenously and showed a 33% increase from baseline urine osmolality with a decrease in diuresis. The patient remained polyuric and highly dependent on fluids due to his hypernatremia. Intranasal desmopressin was started and increased until it reached 40 mcg twice daily intranasally. A brain MRI was then performed to rule out central lymphomatous infiltrates, which came back negative and reinforced a diagnosis of partial NDI. The patient's natremia returned to normal range along with decreased diuresis and intravenous dextrose 5% was stopped. Desmopressin was weaned off and then stopped. The patient was discharged from the hospital on day 18 and remains in remission of his lymphoma.

Brief Hospital Course:

The patient is a 64-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with worsening dyspnea, cough, and unintentional weight loss. She was started on levofloxacin by her primary physician for suspected pneumonia, but her initial antibiotic therapy failed to alleviate her symptoms. A CT scan of the chest revealed multiple cystic lesions in both lungs and a lesion in the liver.

The patient underwent various diagnostic workups to evaluate her lung and liver disease, including viral, bacterial, and fungal infection workups, hepatitis panel, and expanded connective tissue disease workup. Cancer markers showed an elevated cancer antigen 19-9.

An abdominal ultrasound showed innumerable cystic lesions throughout the liver with intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary and pancreatic duct dilatation. Liver biopsy results were not conclusive for a specific diagnosis, which led to a lung biopsy. Pathological examination of the lung tissue showed metastatic moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma in the right upper lobe, middle lobe, and lower lobe.

The patient was referred to an oncologist for further management and treatment. She was provided with appropriate education for her condition, including expected symptoms, potential complications, follow-up care, and necessary lifestyle modifications.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with right upper quadrant abdominal pain that lasted for 8 days and was not associated with eating. During the diagnostic workup, the patient's blood tests and liver function tests revealed no abnormalities except for mild elevation of cytomegalovirus IgG antibody. Further examination showed a mass in the right liver measuring 78 x 71 mm with abundant blood signals. The ultrasound showed that the splenic vein and superior mesenteric vein drained directly into the inferior vena cava while only two branches of hepatic veins drained into the inferior vena cava. Additionally, a mass was noted in the hepatic segment 5, approximately 55 mm in size and poorly demarcated. The patient was suspected to have Abernethy malformation (type II) and concurrent hepatocellular carcinoma or hepatoblastoma.

The patient underwent comprehensive examination and was diagnosed with congenital extrahepatic portal-systemic shunt and coexisting nodular hyperplasia. A transplant was conducted a month after diagnosis in which the diseased right lobe of the liver was resected and an auxiliary piggyback liver transplantation method was conducted. Two years after the transplantation, physical examination as well as CT and MR imaging showed the patient was in a satisfactory condition; the transplanted liver was practically normal in contour and signal intensity. The child is still alive at present, 4 years after surgery.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was admitted with intermittent fever, myalgia, headaches, tinnitus, and an exanthema under his left eye. He was treated with azitromycin for his symptoms, and a skin biopsy revealed a non-specific chronic perivascular dermatitis.

The patient later developed right-sided headache, right-sided rhinorrhea, and a tearing eye, tinnitus of both ears, relapsing (sub)febrile episodes, left facial palsy, an unsteady broad-based gait, a mild action tremor, mild apathy, dysphagia, and hearing loss. An MRI of his brain revealed periventricular white matter lesions and pathological enhancement of multiple cranial nerves.

A diagnostic lumbar puncture was performed, and intrathecal prednisone combined with methotrexate was administered. The CSF showed elevated protein and leukocytes containing non-clonal T-cells. The patient deteriorated five days after the lumbar puncture and intrathecal chemotherapy, with nausea, a nystagmus, and progression of the unstable gait. Repeated CSF analysis did not reveal malignant cells.

The patient's symptoms resolved, and he was discharged on September 22nd without definite diagnosis. He was re-admitted on October 5th with a relapse of dysarthria, dysphagia, cognitive decline, ataxia, and a novel paresis of the right facial nerve. A lumbar puncture was repeated, and a PCR on Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (s.l.) turned out weakly positive.

The patient was diagnosed with neuroborreliosis and treated with ceftriaxone for one month. Finally, minimal dysarthria and dysphagia were the only remaining symptoms after treatment. Serology was negative in all tests performed during and after treatment.

Gender: Female

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with complaints of a left cervical swelling that had been present for 11 months. The mass was painless and had grown rapidly after the end of the breastfeeding period. The patient's family history was unremarkable for cancer. The cervical examination showed a postero-lateral mass of the left neck measuring 6 cm in diameter, painless, of firm consistency, unilobed, soft, adherent to the superficial and deep plane. There was no palpable cervical lymphadenopathy or inflammatory signs of the adjacent skin. Further investigation through cervical MRI revealed a mass of the left posterior cervical soft parts and multiple homolateral supraclavicular and lateral cervical lymph nodes. A biopsy of the mass was performed and concluded as desmoid tumor. Abdominopelvic and thoracic CT scans showed no other progressive lesions elsewhere.

Treatment:
A large resection of the tumor was indicated, and the patient underwent surgery through a direct surgical approach. The mass was found to originate from the trapezius muscle without local infiltration of surrounding structures. Complete excision of the mass was accomplished, involving the fascia and trapezius muscle. A close suction drain was placed, and the patient's safety margins were macroscopically healthy. The post-operative outcomes were simple without any complications, and the patient was discharged from the hospital on postoperative day 5.

Follow-up:
After a three-month follow-up examination, no local or distant tumor recurrence was found. The case was analyzed by a multidisciplinary committee, and it was decided to follow the patient without any adjuvant treatment, given its long-term side-effects and the safety margins are healthy.

The patient is a 17-year-old male who presented with mild hemoptysis after sustaining a blunt trauma to the chest. He fell off a 3-foot cliff while hiking and landed on the right side of his chest. On examination, he had minimal abrasions, ecchymosis, and tenderness over the right lower chest wall. A chest X-ray obtained within 2 hours of the trauma showed alveolar opacities in the right lower lobe with multiple cystic air spaces containing air-fluid levels. A CT scan of the chest showed thick-walled multicystic lesions with patchy air space opacities and consolidations in the right lower lobe, suggestive of CPAM with superimposed bleeding.
 
The patient was admitted for observation and evaluation and placed on intravenous Amoxicillin/Clavulanate. Spirometry done the next day was normal. His complete blood count, basic metabolic panel and bleeding profile were normal. His C-reactive protein was elevated. Gram stain, acid fast stain, and sputum cultures for bacteria, fungi, and tuberculosis were all negative. Alpha-1 antitrypsin and immunoglobulin levels were within normal limits.

Consultation with a cardiothoracic surgeon was done, and a right lower lobectomy was being considered. However, given the indolent course of his disease and his negative history for pulmonary infections thus far, the patient elected to defer further surgical evaluation and, instead, follow-up with clinical observation. He remained asymptomatic throughout the interval period and a chest X-ray repeated after one year was normal. Finally, a CT scan of the chest obtained two years later showed complete resolution of the previously described abnormalities. Due to the fact that his cysts resolved spontaneously with time after his trauma, the patient was finally diagnosed with TPP.

Hospital Course:

This 15-year-old male presented to the neurosurgery clinic with a three-month history of progressively increasing back pain and left-sided leg numbness. He was also experiencing weakness in the lower limbs, particularly on the left side, and reported urinary retention and constipation. MRI revealed an intramedullary lesion extending from T8 to L1 vertebrae involving the conus, and a decompression laminectomy was performed to excise the space occupying lesion. The resected specimen was found to be glioblastoma multiforme.

Post-operatively, the patient experienced reduced sensation and power in the lower limbs but was able to be mobilized using a wheelchair after physical rehabilitation. A multidisciplinary team was consulted, and it was decided that the patient would undergo adjuvant concurrent chemo-radiation (CCRT). He received a total radiation dose of 4500 cGy in 25 fractions with concomitant temozolomide at a dose of 75 mg/m2.

Six weeks post CCRT, the patient showed significant improvement in power of the lower limbs. However, MRI revealed interval development of cystic degeneration with peripheral enhancement in the irradiated area along with cord expansion and edema. Maintenance chemotherapy with temozolomide was continued, and the patient was advised to follow up in the clinic after three months along with a repeat MRI of the craniospinal axis.

On the subsequent follow-up, the patient complained of headache and lower back pain, and there was a substantial decline of power in the lower limbs. MRI showed the interval development of two new rounded lesions at L2-L3 vertebral levels which were suggestive of disease progression. The patient was then referred to palliative care for further management and was discharged home on pain medications. A month later he passed away due to disease progression at home.

The patient, a 4.5-month-old girl, was admitted to the emergency room with a loss of consciousness. She had a history of cough and apathy for the past nine days. The diagnosis of respiratory syncytial virus infection was made by Polymerase Chain Reaction. The patient was transferred to intensive care, where she was intubated and started on broad-spectrum antibiotherapy. After three days of intubation, the patient developed transient peaks of elevated blood pressure and fever. Blood culture and lumbar puncture were negative, but a urinary culture showed the presence of Candida Albicans. Intravenous Fluconazole was initiated, and the patient underwent a renal ultrasound, which showed a right nephromegaly with hyperechoic parenchyma. Further imaging revealed abscesses in the pelvi-calceal system, but surgery was deemed risky due to the potential for long-term growth impairment. A conservative treatment plan of 3 months of Fluconazole was initiated, which led to favorable improvement. The patient suffered two nephritic colic episodes, but there has been no reinfection after six months of being discharged from the hospital.

Hospital Course:
A 73-year-old female with a history of asthma, hypertension, and total thyroidectomy for large goitre presented to the emergency department with complaints of dry cough, lightheadedness, chest pain, and reduced exercise tolerance. She had completed a course of antibiotics 2 weeks ago for respiratory tract infection with partial resolution of symptoms. On general examination, multiple subcutaneous nodules over both arms, chest wall, and back were noted, as well as palpable masses in bilateral breasts with axillary and cervical lymphadenopathy.

The patient was immediately commenced on treatment for acute renal impairment due to acute kidney injury with urea of 24.9 mmol l–1, creatinine 279 mmol l–1, potassium 6.5 mmol l–1 and haemoglobin of 10 g dl–1. Chest X-ray did not show any abnormality. CT of thorax, abdomen and pelvis revealed multiple heterogeneous soft tissue nodules in neck, anterior chest wall on the left, axillary and inguinal regions, anterior abdomen with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; probable lesion in tail of pancreas and cortex of right kidney was described. Subsequent CT-brain showed heterogeneous nodules in parotid glands bilaterally with multiple soft tissue nodules on the scalp. PET scan showed diffuse metastatic disease including diffuse soft tissue nodules, peritoneal masses, inguinal lymphadenopathy and intramuscular deposits.

A biopsy from the breast mass and axillary lymph node confirmed the presence of poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with epithelioid and plasmacytoid morphology, which was consistent with metastatic malignant melanoma. The sample was tested for genetic mutation including BRAF V600E, NRAS, KIT and NTRK1/2/3 fusion of which BRAF V600E mutation was detected.

The patient was then referred to oncology services and commenced on dabrafenib and trametinib. Unfortunately, the patient passed away within 6 months of initial diagnosis.

The patient is a 24-year-old, obese male with a history of Goodpasture syndrome, bilateral ground glass opacities, and bihilar lymphadenopathy. The patient also experienced acute kidney failure, septic shock, metabolic-toxicity, and possibly medication-induced delirium. The patient was intubated with mechanical ventilatory support and underwent testicular sperm extraction.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
Upon admission, the patient presented with a 2-week history of bloody sputum, progressive dyspnea, urine of light pink color, and fever. He had a long duration car travel prior to his complaints. Bilateral ground glass opacities and bihilar lymphadenopathy were documented on CT scan. An empirical antibiotic regime with ceftriaxone and levofloxacin was started. Oxygenation deteriorated rapidly under non-invasive ventilation, and the patient had to be intubated. Positive results for anti-GBM with a high titer of 151 E/ml confirmed the diagnosis of Goodpasture syndrome, which led to therapy with steroids, plasmapheresis, and cyclophosphamide. A testicular sperm extraction was performed according to the patient's presumed wish to reproduce in the future. The patient received immediate chemotherapy, a step down regimen of corticosteroids adapted to anti-GBM value, as well as daily plasmapheresis for a total of 14 days. Following initial therapy, acute kidney failure developed with the need for continuous hemodialysis. A septic shock following a non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia required a specific antibiotic therapy as well as terminal ileum resection with ileostomy, subtotal colectomy, and Hartmann procedure. A dilative tracheotomy was performed due to an unsuccessful attempt to wean the patient from mechanical ventilatory support. The patient recovered from the acute illness with successful removal of the tracheal cannula but ongoing need for renal replacement therapy.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
Goodpasture syndrome, acute renal failure, septic shock, non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia, metabolic-toxicity, and possibly medication-induced delirium.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient should receive a low dosage of steroids (prednisone 5 mg/day) as part of the control for Goodpasture syndrome. Close monitoring of anti-GBM antibodies (actually 14 E/ml) is necessary.

Patient Name: Anonymous

Age: 43

Sex: Male

Clinical Summary:

The patient was a 43-year-old male without any significant medical history, who presented with progressive blurred vision for almost six months. Bilateral visual field defects were found under visual field examination. The patient's high cortical functions were intact. Cranial nerve function was also normal, except for bilateral lower temporal hemiapnosia. Anatomical MRI examination revealed a mass lesion over sellar and suprasellar regions with heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and a cystic component that caused upward compression of the optic chiasm. After the provisional diagnosis of craniopharyngioma, endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery was performed for tumor removal. 

Hospital Course:

The patient underwent endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery (ETS) performed by a single surgeon via a single nostril. The approach was performed using a standard technique, and the tumor was completely removed with the diaphragm sella intact without cerebrospinal fluid leakage. After surgery, the patient had no neurological deficit, electrolyte imbalance, diabetes insipitus (DI) sign, or hormone deficiency. The original visual field defect also improved after surgery. Post-operative images indicated no residual or recurrent tumor within the two-year follow-up period. 

Diagnosis:

Based on the microscopic examination, the tumor was composed of delicate fibrovascular cores covered by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), focally positive for S-100, and non-reactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Immunohistochemical stain with multiple pituitary hormones, including ACTH, PRL, FSH, LH, GH, and TSH, was negative. Based on these results, we diagnosed CPP.

Discharge Instructions:

The patient completed the endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery for CPP and had a successful outcome. With the absence of clinical symptoms or immediate postoperative complications, the patient was discharged in stable condition. Follow-up consultations with the treating physician for imaging and laboratory examination are recommended. No further specific medications or restrictions are required.",,,0

The patient is a 41-year-old female with a history of left ovarian endometriotic cyst, uterine myomas, and breast cancer. She underwent left mastectomy and axillary lymphadenectomy, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy for her breast cancer and was taking gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist and tamoxifen. 

Medical History:
The patient was initially diagnosed with a left ovarian endometriotic cyst and uterine myomas at the age of 34. At the age of 37, an MRI revealed an endometriotic cyst in her left ovary that showed high intensity on T2WI and intermediate-to-low intensity on T1WI without any solid component. 

At the age of 40, she had intermittent vaginal bleeding lasting 6 months. Endometrial biopsy was performed, revealing endometrioid carcinoma, Grade 1. On this occasion, solid areas with strong enhancement were observed within the haemorrhagic cyst on MRI. PET-CT demonstrated FDG uptake in the solid portion of the left ovarian tumour. A malignant left ovarian tumour with endometrial cancer was suspected.

Diagnosis:
The patient underwent surgery, and the 3-cm left ovarian cyst was adherent to the peritoneum. Intraoperative frozen section analysis demonstrated a seromucinous borderline tumour. In FFPE specimens, a left ovarian cyst was identified, with intracystic proliferation of papillary endometrioid epithelium with cellular and structural atypia. The case was diagnosed as Endometrioid Borderline Tumour (EBT) of the ovary, pT1aN0M0, and endometrioid carcinoma Grade 1 of the uterine endometrium, pT1aN0M0.

The patient complained of central abdominal colic pain with discontinued exhaust and defecation, likely due to mechanical ileus after 2 courses of chemotherapy, which was treated nonsurgically. The patient maintained a relatively stable condition with a liquid or semi-liquid diet. The patient completed 8 courses of chemotherapy and was discharged after a 12-month follow-up period, during which colonoscopy and CTE did not reveal any obvious fistulae, and the patient's diet and defecation were normal.

Diagnostic Findings:
Laboratory tests showed an OB-positive stool, 20.24 mg/L CRP, and negative results for all tumor markers and tuberculosis tests. The transabdominal US, contrast-enhanced CT, and PET/CT confirmed the presence of an abnormal thickening in the sigmoid colon, ileal-sigmoid fistula, and large diffuse B-cell lymphoma, respectively.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient was admitted with abdominal pain and diarrhea that had lasted for a year. Testing revealed an abnormal thickening in the sigmoid colon, ileal-sigmoid fistula, and large diffuse B-cell lymphoma.

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented with right groin pain and back pain over a period of more than 2 years. A year later, he started to feel pain and swelling in the right gluteal region. The patient received analgesics at that time, which did not help much.

Hospital Course:
Conventional radiography of the lumbar spine showed mild left convex scoliosis and a partially elicited right iliac wing osteolytic lesion. Conventional radiography of the pelvis revealed a large osteolytic lesion involving the right iliac crest and wing with sclerotic margins and no obvious dominant gross matrix calcifications. MR examination of the pelvis showed a huge mass arising from the superior aspect of the right iliac wing, which is generally T1 homogenous hypointense and T2 heterogeneous hyperintense signal with internal dominant fluid-equivalent signal and peripheral nodular hypointense margin. The mass is saddle shaped, overhanging the right iliac crest with a pelvic (internal) limb displacing and attenuating the right iliopsoas muscle without invasion of the iliac vessels and gluteal (external) limb extending into the gluteal region between the gluteal medius and minimus muscles. No evidence of invasion or encasement of the surrounding structures or adjacent iliac vessels was observed, and there was no defined regional pelvic lymphadenopathy.

Chief Complaint:
The patient presented with a 1-day history of melena associated with epigastric pain following food ingestion, dyspepsia, dizziness, and palpitations.

History of Present Illness:
Prior to admission, the patient also had a 14-day history of postprandial nausea and nonbloody vomiting. Physical examination revealed severe conjunctival pallor and melenic stool on digital rectal examination.

Hospital Course:
The patient was resuscitated with 4 units of whole blood, normal saline, and ringers lactate. The differential diagnosis was upper GI bleeding secondary to peptic ulcer disease. The patient was started empirically on esomeprazole and had a nasogastric tube inserted. Due to the lack of resources including endoscopy, a functional computed tomography (CT) imaging unit, and inability to refer the patient 2 hours away to obtain imaging diagnostics, a clinical diagnosis of upper gastrointestinal bleeding was made based on the presence of melena and severe anemia, contrary to lower GI bleeding which usually presents with hematochezia. A decision for an emergent explorative laparotomy was done. Because this is a low-resource setting, there was no availability of endoscopy for laparoscopic surgery. Under general anesthesia, the abdominal cavity was entered through an upper midline incision. A gastrogastric intussusception was found. The portion of the stomach at the level of the tumor was devascularized. The intussusception was reduced by gently applying pressure on the body of the stomach to reduce the intussusception. Wedge resection was performed at the fundus followed by primary anastomosis. The tumor was completely resected with at least 0.2 cm clearance.

Marked swelling at both lower extremities was observed. An incisional biopsy of the left inguinal lymph node revealed metastatic round cell tumor with characteristics consistent with malignant melanoma.

Further investigation was conducted to locate the primary tumors in the patient's lower extremities, abdominal cavity, and anogenital organ, but no evidence of lesion was found. A Computerized Tomography (CT) scan of the patient's abdomen showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes throughout the abdominal and pelvic cavity, along with compression of both iliac veins.

The patient was diagnosed with metastatic melanoma of unknown primary, and underwent 20 Gy of palliative radiotherapy for bilateral inguinal lymph nodes. Subsequently, chemotherapy was prescribed with carboplatin (AUC5) and paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 for 6 cycles. After the completion of chemotherapy, the patient's symptoms improved, and the CT scan showed a gradual decrease in the size of the tumors.

During the follow-up period, the patient developed multiple depigmented patches around the lips, trunk, and periorbital and inguinal area, which are typical of vitiligo.

Given the reimbursement issue, the patient could not access an immune checkpoint inhibitor or targeted drug according to a national reimbursement policy.

As of the latest follow-up in November 2017, the patient remains stable with gradual tumor regression.

Procedures Performed: Right posterolateral thoracotomy, double sleeve lobectomy of right upper and middle lobes, systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection, resection of the superior vena cava (SVC) with interposition of a ringed graft of 12mm in diameter, reconstruction of right pulmonary artery (PA) trunk and right lower PA

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our department for a continuous irritable cough over 15 days and was diagnosed with poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma by transbronchial tumor biopsy. The tumor was located in the right upper lobe and directly invaded the arch of the right PA, a wide range of SVC and the left brachiocephalic vein. Magnetic resonance imaging, CT scan and bone nuclear scans revealed no detectable metastases in other organs.

A right posterolateral thoracotomy was performed, with resection of the tumor and SVC, and reconstruction of the right PA trunk and right lower PA. The left brachiocephalic vein bifurcation was not observed. A ringed graft of 12mm in diameter was interpositioned between the right brachiocephalic vein and the origin of the SVC. The double sleeve lobectomy of right upper and middle lobes was performed, followed by systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection. 

Postoperatively, the patient was given low molecular heparin on the operative day and switched to warfarin when thoracic drains were removed. The patient recovered in an uneventful manner and was discharged from the hospital on the 12th postoperative day.

Follow-up:

After 4 cycles of chemotherapy (Gemzar and cisplatin) and 1 cycle of radiotherapy, chest MRI showed patency of the graft and PLSVC. The patient died 21 months after the operation due to remote metastasis.

Admitting Diagnosis: Stage IIIA lung cancer
Final Diagnosis: Scapular dislocation and localized infection

Hospital Course:
A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to our institute for a right upper lobectomy to treat a stage IIIA lung cancer. The surgery involved an extended resection of the posterior chest wall with the third to fifth rib being cut. The chest wall defect was covered using Gore-Tex®, a pure and unique expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prosthesis. The postoperative period was uneventful. However, on postoperative day 6, the patient reported acute severe pain in the right shoulder. Purulent drainage was also observed through the drainage tube that was positioned on the mesh. Pus culture from the drain discharge isolated Corynebacterium atrium. CT revealed that the inferior angle of the scapula was caught inside the top of the sixth rib. Conservative treatment was initiated, but failed to improve the scapular dislocation, and a redo surgery with titanium plate fifth rib fixation was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed that all suture threads attaching the mesh to sixth rib were cut, and the dislocation of the right scapula with the inferior angle protruding into the right intrathoracic cavity through the thoracotomy defect. A local infectious change at the head side of the mesh was observed but no macroscopic intrathoracic infectious changes were found. After the removal of mesh, washing with 10 L of physiologic saline was carried out. Continuous lavages with physiologic saline of the thoracic cavity and antibiotic therapies were also performed for 21 days. After removal of drainage tube, there was no recurrence of infection and scapular dislocation. The patient had full range of motion of his right shoulder without pain. He is currently doing well with no recurrences of cancer, infection, or scapular dislocation, 16 months after the redo surgery.

Patient Name: __________
Medical Record Number: __________
Date of Admission: __________
Date of Discharge: __________
Length of Stay: __________

History and Reason for Admission:
The patient is a 28-year-old female with no significant past medical history who presented with sudden onset periumbilical pain that migrated to the right iliac fossa accompanied by intermittent fever, nausea, and loss of appetite. The examination by two senior surgeons revealed guarding and rebound tenderness at the right iliac fossa. Hematological tests showed polymorphonuclear leukocytosis with left shift. USG could not visualize appendix. An Alvarado score of 9/10 was calculated, leading to the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Laparotomy was performed, and intraoperatively, the appendix appeared normal.

Hospital Course:
During the laparotomy, a hemorrhagic lesion appeared little deeper in the mid abdomen when the medial edge of the incision was retracted superomedially. To further explore this lesion, the incision was extended transversely from the medial edge. The exploration revealed an ulcerated lesion measuring 7 × 5 cm arising from the antimesenteric border of the ileum 8 feet from ICJ with localized interloop hemoperitoneum and inflammatory exudates. Resection of ileal segment containing the lesion was performed followed by restoration of bowel continuity and peritoneal toileting. Subsequently, the lesion was reported to be an ulcerated malignant ileal GIST. On gross examination, the growth from the ileum had villous lining epithelium with focal ulceration. The submucosal region had a circumscribed nodule with proliferation of loosely cohesive spindle cells; some of which were arranged in vague storiform pattern and others in long fascicles. The patient had an uneventful recovery and was discharged on the 8th postoperative day. She was advised to review a week later at the outpatients but failed to report.

Diagnosis:
The diagnosis in this case is an ulcerated malignant ileal gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

Treatment:
The treatment for the patient's condition was surgical resection of the ileal segment containing the lesion followed by restoration of bowel continuity and peritoneal toileting.

Follow-Up Care:
The patient was advised to review a week later at the outpatients but failed to report. All possible contacts were used to trace her, but she remained inaccessible and lost to follow-up.

The patient was admitted to the surgical oncology unit for a planned transanal excision of a large polyp of the mid rectum. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia without any intraoperative complications. Postoperatively, the patient received prophylaxis for venous thrombosis with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). On day 3, the patient developed a spike in temperature without any suspicious clinical evidences. The laboratory data showed deranged coagulation profile with marked prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), raised white blood cells count (WBC), and procalcitonin level. A computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis was performed which did not show any pelvic abscess, but there was evidence of perirectal fat suffusion related to the recent procedure. A rigid proctoscopy was performed showing the evidence of the partial dehiscence of rectal wall defect suture; no other abnormalities were noticed. Antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole three times a day. For prophylaxis of venous thrombosis, LMWH was resumed. In the next 7 days, the patient had no more fever and laboratory data improved while APTT was still prolonged. The patient was discharged home with no further intervention.

The 61-year-old African American female patient was admitted to the gastroenterology clinic for diagnostic esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy. She had a history of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), dyspepsia, abdominal bloating, early satiety, alternating constipation, and diarrhea. The patient reported compliance with split dose 4L polyethylene glycol 3350 solution bowel preparation. During the procedures, she was intubated given her medical comorbidities.

Findings:

During EGD, the patient was noted to have a hiatal hernia and a scant amount of opaque, whitish, chalky residue in her stomach. The digital rectal examination prior to colonoscopy revealed a similar substance with a yellowish tinge. Colonoscopy revealed the substance coating significant portions of the colonic mucosa, which interfered with the visualization of the mucosa. On withdrawal, a large pedunculated polyp was found in the ascending colon, estimated to be 15 mm in size. Several attempts to clear the biopsy channel were unsuccessful, and the colonoscopy was aborted.

Treatment:

The patient was instructed to discontinue her Tums medication and was scheduled for repeat colonoscopy one month later, which showed complete resolution of the foreign substance. A histopathological examination revealed a 9 mm tubular adenoma in the ascending colon and several small hyperplastic polyps in the sigmoid colon. The biopsy channel on the colonoscope used during the sentinel colonoscopy was easily cleared with standard cleaning practices and did not require refurbishment.

Admitting Diagnosis: Osteolytic tumor in the metadiaphysis of the right distal femur

Discharge Diagnosis: Desmoplastic fibroma with low-grade osteosarcoma

Hospital course: The patient was admitted with progressive pain in the right hip region that had existed for 1 year. X-ray images showed an osteolytic tumor in the metadiaphysis of the right distal femur with cortical bone destruction on the dorsolateral side. The central part of the tumor had no matrix calcification. On MRI, the tumor destroyed the cortex and extended to the surrounding soft tissues. A resection of the right distal femur was performed. The tumor in the distal femur measured 12 × 4 cm. On cut surface the tumor was pale and fibrous. There was extension to the surrounding soft tissue. Tumor histology strongly resembled the desmoplastic fibroma diagnosed in case 1, however, with some differences. As shown in Fig. a, this tumor also consisted of bundles of moderate cellular tissue, with fibroblast-like, spindle cells in abundant collagenous stroma. However, there was evidence of invasive growth in trabecular bone and surrounding skeletal muscle tissue. Although nuclear chromatin was bland, few normal mitoses were found. Osteoid or trabecular bone was absent. With cytogenetic analysis, we found an abnormal karyotype: 47~49,XX,del(13) (q12q32),+ 1~2r,+1~2mar,1dmin [cp17]/46,XX [2]. This encompasses an interstitial deletion of the long arm of chromosome 13 (q12q32), consistent with heterozygous loss of the RB1 tumor suppressor gene. With cancer hotspot NGS analysis, we found amplification of CDK4 (NM_000075.3) and an imbalance of the RB1 gene on chromosome 13. With IHC, tumor cells exhibited strong nuclear staining for CDK4 and moderate nuclear staining for SATB2. RB1 expression was heterogeneous, not completely lost. A conclusive diagnosis of DF-LGOS could be made, based on histologic features (an invasive fibroblastic tumor with mitotic activity), karyotyping (heterozygous loss of RB1) and molecular genetics/IHC (CDK4 amplification).

Outcome: The patient underwent a successful resection of the tumor and was discharged in stable condition.

Patient Information: A 42 year old male with a history of oligodendroglioma and newly diagnosed metastatic malignant melanoma, who presented with a 20 pound unintentional weight loss over a 3 month period and new left axillary lymphadenopathy.

Hospital Course:

The patient initially received systemic ipilimumab for his metastatic melanoma, followed by treatment with pembrolizumab after experiencing disease progression. Despite multiple lines of therapy, the patient's disease continued to progress. Nine months after receiving his genetically engineered T-cell infusion, he proceeded to treatment with HD IL-2.

During his first course of treatment with HD IL-2, the patient experienced the expected adverse effects but had an uncomplicated recovery. His second course of treatment, however, resulted in diffuse myalgias and a rapid rise in serum CK levels, leading to rhabdomyolysis. Further investigations revealed a rare immune-mediated toxicity causing necrotizing myopathy.

The patient received supportive care and aggressive intravenous hydration, resulting in full recovery from this episode of rhabdomyolysis. Due to this unusual toxicity, a muscle biopsy was performed.

The biopsy revealed rare myofiber necrosis and myophagocytosis and an infiltrate of T-lymphocytes and macrophages, suggestive of an immune-mediated toxicity causing necrotizing myopathy. The engineered T-cells remained detectable in the circulation, but it was difficult to ascertain if they were present in the muscle tissue. The patient was discharged home and follow-up PET/CT imaging revealed a near complete response. At follow-up, the patient was found to have new onset vitiligo involving his neck, upper back, chest, and upper arms.

Hospital Course:
Patient 3 was admitted to the hospital with recurrence of squamous cell cervical cancer that originally presented as FIGO stage 1B and was treated with radiation therapy. She subsequently developed metastases in the lungs, adrenal gland, and paraspinal tissues and was treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel and bevacizumab and palliative radiotherapy (2700 cGy) to the paraspinal mass. On progression, she was started on a Phase I clinical trial called PRIMETIME (NCT02518958), which involves dosing of nivolumab with the experimental epigenetic and macrophage and cancer stem cell-targeting agent, RRx-001.

At her first 6-week restaging scan, the patient showed stable disease with an approximately 10% reduction in tumor size. Her second 12-week restaging scan demonstrated significant growth of the paraspinal thoracic mass with apparent encroachment of the spinal canal at the level of T5 even while the rest of her lesions continued to diminish in size (). However, most unusually, the patient did not describe any neurological symptoms. In fact, the day before, the patient went for a 3-mile run. Her chief—and only—complaint was back pain for which she took gabapentin (100 mg, PO) and oxycodone (5 mg, PO, PRN). On physical examination, the patient was neurologically intact with normal reflexes, muscle tone, and sphincter functions and negative Babinski signs.

One week later, the patient underwent surgical resection without incident and with postoperative resolution of her back pain. Pathology of the tumor showed the replacement of necrotic tumor cells with collagenous scar. The rest of her lesions continued to diminish in size in the absence of any treatment, possibly due to surgically induced immunogenicity effects.

The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with her oncologist and primary care provider for further evaluation and management of her condition. She was provided with referrals to appropriate specialists as needed. The patient was instructed to continue taking her prescribed medications, as ordered, and to report any new symptoms or concerns to her healthcare provider.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 10-year-old girl, was admitted to our center due to lack of balance and urinary incontinence that the patient experienced from three weeks ago. Upon examination, cerebellar tests indicated abnormalities as well as deep tendon reflexes were diminished, and Babinski sign was detected bilaterally.

Further tests performed included brain and cervico-thoraco-lumbar magnetic resonance imaging and Lumbar puncture, which turned out to be normal. Biochemical tests, however, revealed high concentration of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and anemia. Upon examination, elevated mean corpuscular volume (MCV) with hyper segmented neutrophil in peripheral blood smear was noted, and the diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia was established. Consequently, vitamin B12 and folate levels were assessed, and the serum level of vitamin B12 was found to be significantly lower than the normal range, whereas the range of folate was normal.

To rule out various other diseases, gastrointestinal transit evaluation, endoscopy, biopsy, and other specific tests were carried out. Finally, the diagnosis of Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome was established owing to the investigations and hematologic and nephrological findings.

The patient was treated with high-dose of vitamin B12 daily injection leading to improved balance. In one-month follow-up, the patient was completely recovered, had no incontinency, however, proteinuria persists.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 62-year-old woman, presented to our institution with abdominal pain in October 2011. She was diagnosed with carcinosarcoma with high-grade serous adenocarcinoma component associated with high-grade endometrial sarcoma in the right ovary and fallopian tube, with peritoneal implants in the upper abdomen and pelvis.

From April through June 2012, the patient received adjuvant carboplatin and paclitaxel for four cycles, followed by intraperitoneal cisplatin and intravenous and intraperitoneal paclitaxel for six additional cycles. She received tamoxifen as maintenance treatment for 4 months and was observed off treatment for 6 months. In May 2013, retroperitoneal adenopathy was discovered following a serial rise in CA125, which prompted radiographic assessment. She received carboplatin, pegylated liposomal doxorubicin, and bevacizumab for four cycles and had a partial response. 

From April 2014 through December 2015, the patient received various treatments for platinum-resistant disease. Pemetrexed, nab-paclitaxel, megestrol, capecitabine, and vinorelbine were administered. Despite the extensive pretreatment, she remained largely asymptomatic and had a good performance status. However, owing to disease progression, she initiated treatment with pembrolizumab in January 2016. After the fourth cycle, PET/CT showed objective partial response in the left external iliac lymph nodes, as well as in the right-posterior pectoral lymph node conglomerate. Another major site of metastatic disease was the right retropulmonary lymph nodes. 

The patient underwent radiotherapy with the goal of increasing local control and potentially causing an abscopal effect. She then received an additional four cycles of pembrolizumab. Unfortunately, disease progression was discovered in the liver shortly thereafter. She received olaparib for 2 months but without response, and she died in October 2016.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction

History: The patient has a history of excessive intake of alcohol and locally grown tobacco use for several years.

Hospital Course: The patient was admitted to the hospital due to chronic persistent swallowing dysfunction for six months. White light endoscopy revealed a 22 mm flat lesion in the middle esophagus. The lesion was covered with scattered leukoplakia and normal vascular network could not be seen in the lesion. The patient received narrow-band imaging (NBI) under endoscopy which revealed the lesion with an indistinct brownish area, local white penniform area and white tiny papillary surface structure. Further low and high magnifying endoscopy with NBI (ME-NBI) showed tiny irregular papillary microsurface structure with various shapes and sizes, and non-typical intraepithelial papillary capillary loops (IPCL) confined to the papillary microsurface structure. Iodine staining endoscopy showed a less-stained lesion and showed more distinct white tiny papillary surface structure than conventional white light endoscopy. Biopsy showed a low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia. Chest and abdominal CT scan revealed no abnormal lesions. The endoscopic manifestations under WLE, ME-NBI, and iodine staining endoscopy, combining with pathology, led to the diagnosis of early esophageal cancer. Therefore, endoscopic therapy was chosen. The lesion was completely resected with endoscopic submucosal dissection. The lesion was histopathologically confirmed as early VCCE which was limited within the mucosal lamina propria (m2) and completely resected. There were no lymphovascular and neural invasions of cancer cells, and no cancer cells to be seen in the lateral and vertical margin of the resected specimen (the distance of the lesion to the closest margin of the resected specimen was 3.012mm).

Disposition: The patient is discharged in good condition.

Chief Complaint: Persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor

History of Present Illness: The patient, a 20-year-old Caucasian male, was admitted to the medical department with persistent hyperpyrexia, severe sore throat, dyspnea, and impaired consciousness with stupor. The symptoms had started at home four days before and he assumed clarithromycin as empiric antibiotic therapy. The physical examination showed pharyngeal hyperemia in the tonsillar region and soft palate and left laterocervical lymphadenopathy. The laboratory tests showed total bilirubin 5.8 mg/dL, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 43 mg/L, AST 150 UI/L, and ALT 79 UI/L. The nasopharyngeal swab testing for SARS-CoV-2 was negative (RT-PCR). Blood cultures were carried out upon admission, and a full-body computer tomography (CT) was performed on the second day of hospitalization. The CT showed ground glass bilateral pulmonary alterations, pericardial effusion, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and hepatosplenomegaly. The neck CT scan with intravenous contrast evidenced a 5.4 cm retropharyngeal abscess with associated thrombosis of the left anterior jugular vein. On the second day of hospitalization, the microbiology laboratory communicated the early identification of Fusobacterium necrophorum grown in blood cultures by MALDI-TOF spectrometry.

Hospital Course: The patient was referred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to rapid worsening of the clinical conditions with further impairment of respiratory failure and severe hemodynamic alterations. A multimodal approach was the core of the ICU management of Lemierre’s septic syndrome. It included source control, antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant therapy, hemodynamic support, and continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). The source control includes an explorative puncture of the retropharyngeal abscess under general anesthesia and surgical tracheostomy for airway protection. The patient showed a clinical and radiological picture of acute lung injury and required mechanical ventilation. About antibiotic therapy, metronidazole was added to piperacillin/tazobactam. Hemodynamic support was based on the synergic association of norepinephrine and the non-adrenergic vasopressor argipressin. There was an enhancement in the clinical conditions, and the biomarkers of inflammation and organ failure improved. Despite the adequate mean arterial pressure, there was a new worsening of the clinical status featured anemia without evidence of a hemorrhagic source. The hemodynamic monitoring showed a hyperdynamic septic state. Due to the worsening of the sepsis-related organ damage, hydrocortisone was added to argipressin and norepinephrine, leading to paramount hemodynamic improvement. Continuous hemofiltration was carried out to treat the inflammatory response by four cycles. Heparin therapy was administered throughout the entire stay according to thrombocytopenia monitoring and avoiding intravascular coagulopathy. On the 9th day, a chest tube was placed for the drainage of lung pleural effusion, and a new CT showed a persistence of known injuries of the lungs, liver, and spleen despite the paramount improvements of laboratory and clinical values, as well as hemodynamic parameters at monitoring. The patient was discharged to the ward on the 17th day to continue the antibiotic therapy and the rehabilitation program.

Hospital Course:
X was admitted to the emergency department of our level 1 trauma centre following a high-speed motor vehicle accident. Her initial survey revealed that she was haemodynamically stable. A routine whole body scan was performed as part of the institution's polytrauma protocol. CT scan showed multiple injuries including multiple rib fractures, lung contusions, moderate haemoperitoneum, grade 4 right kidney injury, right adrenal gland haematoma, and Grade 5 liver lacerations in the right lobe extending to the right and middle hepatic veins, with a centrally located filling defect in the suprahepatic inferior vena cava extending to the base of the right atrium. The patient required multiple transfusions during the first days of admission and maintained mildly elevated INR and fibrinogen levels.

Following admission, the patient's early complications were monitored and managed, including severe polytrauma, respiratory or haemodynamic decompensation, bleeding and coagulopathy. During the first days of admission, the patient received multiple transfusions including packed red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma, and platelets. Her haemoglobin level continued to decrease from 12.3 g dl-1 on day 1 to 6.5 g dl-1 on day 3. The patient's haemodynamic status and haemoglobin levels stabilized by day 5 and prophylactic low molecular weight heparin were started. On day 6, an abdominal ultrasound was performed to evaluate the IVC. Intermittent macroscopic haematuria was noted but the decision was made to hold on starting therapeutic anticoagulation since no clinical or laboratory signs of IVC thrombus progression were identified. A repeat contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis on day 3 of admission demonstrated an increased haemoperitoneum, stable solid organ injuries, and IVC thrombus without active bleeding. The patient remained stable and was discharged home on day 10.

Diagnosis:
High-grade transitional cell carcinoma with metastasis to lymph nodes

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with cystitis which led to the diagnosis of high-grade transitional cell carcinoma. The initial staging showed no nodal involvement and the patient received neoadjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin chemotherapy. However, restaging after three cycles of chemotherapy showed malignancy in two iliac lymph nodes. The treating hospital administered radiotherapy to the pelvic nodes, including the suspicious pelvic node, and bilateral nodal volume. MMC and 5-FU chemotherapy were also given concurrently.

The patient tolerated the therapy well, with no adverse effects. Despite the regression of pelvic lymphadenopathy on the post-treatment restaging scan, significant lymphadenopathy was noted in the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, and both sides of the neck. A biopsy confirmed the metastatic TCC.

The patient underwent vinflunine chemotherapy, which had to be discontinued due to neutropenia. Metastatic liver lesions developed, and the patient was started on weekly paclitaxel, which continues for 9 months after completing radical treatment.

Clinical Course:
The patient presented with high-grade transitional cell carcinoma with no nodal involvement. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy showed malignancy in two iliac lymph nodes, and radiotherapy was given alongside MMC and 5-FU chemotherapy. Although the pelvic lymphadenopathy regressed, lymphadenopathy outside the radiotherapy volume was noted, confirmed to be metastatic TCC. 

The patient developed neutropenia during vinflunine chemotherapy, and the treatment was stopped. Metastatic liver lesions were found, and the patient underwent weekly paclitaxel for 9 months after completing radical treatment.

Disposition:
The patient was discharged in stable condition and will follow up with the treating hospital for further management of her medical condition. The oncology team will continue to monitor the patient's progress and offer supportive care as necessary.

Date of Admission: Not provided.
Date of Discharge: Not provided.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 35-year-old male, was admitted to the out-patient department with complaints of recurrent abdominal pain and general weakness for 1 week. Initial computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a large cystic lesion in the upper abdomen. On physical examination, an immovable abdominal mass was detected in the upper quadrant and the tenderness and rebound-tenderness of the whole abdomen were obvious. The patient was admitted to the general surgery department because of this condition.

On laboratory investigation, mild leukocytosis and elevated C reactive protein (CRP) were observed. However, tumor markers were within the normal range. The US showed that a large cystic lesion occupied the abdomen. The review result of the CT scan showed a large cystic lesion of the abdominal cavity, which was considered a lymphatic cyst combined with purulent inflammation.

The laparoscopic exploration was not possible because of the volume of tumor occupied most of the abdominal cavity interspace. Therefore, the patient underwent excision laparotomy of the cyst based on clinical and radiological findings. A cystic lesion measuring approximately 40.0 cm × 30.0 cm originated from the body of pancreas and extended into the mesocolon. The tumor invaded to the spleen and no invasion into vascular structures. In order to retain the pancreatic secretion function and achieve radical resection effect of the patient, distal pancreatectomy (including the cyst, the body, and tail of pancreas) and splenectomy were performed.

The final pathological diagnosis was pancreatic cystic lymphangioma. After 19 days of hospitalization, the patient was discharged without any complications.",,,0

The patient is a 4-year-old male who was admitted to our hospital due to respiratory tract infection, splenomegaly, and thrombocytopenia. Upon admission, the patient exhibited several distinct facial features, including low nasal bridge, prominent epicanthic fold, hypertelorism, and low-set ears. He also had congenital bilateral club feet and cryptorchidism, as well as delayed speech and motor development. Laboratory tests indicated an abnormal increase of white blood cell count and hypochromic anemia. A bone marrow aspiration smear revealed trilineage myelodysplasia and decreased platelet production from megakaryocyte, leading to the diagnosis of juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).

The patient was treated with supportive care, including transfusions and antibiotics for infections. Unfortunately, the patient died before chemotherapy could be started and bone marrow transplantation performed.

Assessment and Plan:

Whole-exome sequencing of the patient's peripheral blood DNA revealed a heterozygous missense mutation (c.34G > A, p.Gly12Ser) in the KRAS gene, which could be categorized as pathogenic. Sanger sequencing was applied to confirm the mutation. The parental blood sample and patient's buccal swab sample were analyzed and determined that the KRAS mutation was absent, indicating the presence of a somatic mutation. A pathogenic deletion encompassing 7311 kb in size was also detected, involving OMIM genes, including NRG3, CDHR1, RGR, LDB3, BMPR1A, and GLUD1.

Throughout the patient's hospital stay, his treatment was tailored to his condition and monitored closely by a multidisciplinary team of physicians. A comprehensive discussion regarding the patient's treatment and management was held with the patient's family and caregivers.

The patient's treatment was focused on supportive care and managing his symptoms. Unfortunately, the patient's condition worsened, and he was unable to undergo chemotherapy or bone marrow transplantation before his passing.

Diagnosis: Parakeratinized Variant of OKC

Hospital Course:
The patient reported a vague pain on the left side of her face, which was throbbing and radiating to the left eye. She also reported a transient diplopia in an upward gaze and epiphora occasionally, which could be due to the tumor expansion causing compression of the nasolacrimal duct. On examination, she had vestibular obliteration extending from the left first premolar up to the second molar. A cystic lesion was palpated over the premolar region, and aspiration yielded cheesy material consisting of keratin flakes. No symptoms of sinusitis were present. Radiological investigations revealed a high posterior impacted third molar in the maxilla abutting the floor of the orbit. The patient underwent a Caldwell-Luc operation, a trapezoidal flap was raised, and fenestration on the bony wall exposed the keratin cheesy lining, which was enucleated along with peripheral ostectomy to remove any traces of epithelial remnants. The intrinsic bony erosion enabled the surgeon to trace and remove the third molar. A middle meatus nasal antrostomy was performed to attain a physiological sinus drainage. An endoscopy was performed to assure total removal of the cyst lining, and a clinical and radiological follow-up was done.

Treatment:
The patient underwent a Caldwell-Luc operation, peripheral ostectomy, and a middle meatus nasal antrostomy to attain a physiological sinus drainage.

Follow-up:
The patient's wound healing was uneventful, and she showed remission of epiphora and diplopia following a 1-year follow-up.

A 51-year-old Japanese man was referred to our hospital for abnormal ultrasound findings. His past history included diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and fatty liver. Physical examination showed nothing of note, and laboratory findings were within normal range. A contrast computed tomography scan revealed a mass closely adjoining the left external iliac vein, which was diagnosed to be a leiomyosarcoma, probably derived from the left external iliac vein.

Treatment:

Before surgery, the patient's vascular surgeons discussed how to deal with the left iliac vein. The patient was engaged in physical labor and did not want to take an anticoagulant after surgery. So, combined resection of the left iliac vein with the tumor was conducted. The extirpation of the tumor was successful, and complete tumor resection was achieved.

Pathology:

Pathological examination revealed that the tumor was a well-defined, gross, firm mass of 60 mm at the greatest diameter, mostly composed of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with a mild to moderate degree of cellular pleomorphism. It was considered to be a low-grade leiomyosarcoma. Immunostaining for α-SMA was positive, and positive ratio of MIB-1 was low at 5-10%.

Recovery:

Immediately after surgery, the patient developed left leg pain and swelling. However, the painful swelling of his left thigh improved one week later and ultimately disappeared by about 3 months after surgery. The patient has remained free from recurrence at 30 months after surgery.

Conclusion:

The diagnosis is venous leiomyosarcoma originating from a branch vessel of the left external iliac vein. The combined resection of the left iliac vein with the tumor was successful, with the patient showing no signs of recurrence 30 months after surgery.",,,0

The patient was admitted to our hospital presenting with cough associated with hemoptysis, mild intermittent fever, mild left-sided pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath on exertion, which had persisted for six months since the radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for refractory atrial fibrillation (AF) at our hospital. A comprehensive evaluation including chest radiography and laboratory studies was done at a primary health centre close to his residency, without obtaining a definitive diagnosis. The patient was given broad-spectrum antibiotics and referred to our pulmonology clinic for further investigation.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
Non-enhanced CT was done and showed the presence of increased parenchymal attenuation and multiple peripheral patchy consolidations in the apico-posterior and anterior segments of the left upper lobe associated with minimal left pleural effusion. Ultrasound-guided aspiration of the left-sided pleural effusion was carried out, and the obtained specimen was fluid of serous nature. Besides that, lung biopsy was also performed and the histopathologic examination revealed surprisingly intimal hyperplasia associated with multifocal haemorrhagic infarction due to PVO and hypertensive pulmonary arteriopathy. After that, a contrast-enhanced CT scan with 3D reconstruction showed an occluded left superior pulmonary vein (LSPV), which was confirmed by conventional angiography. Ventilation/perfusion scan demonstrated absent perfusion of the involved lung parenchyma and left upper lobectomy was warranted.

Follow-Up:
The patient underwent the surgical procedure of left upper lobectomy and showed noticeable improvement post-surgery. He was discharged with recommendations to follow the regular follow-up schedules as suggested by the treating team and to follow the regular medication and precautionary advice as per the treating physician.

The patient is a 25-year-old female with a history of obesity who had undergone RYGB 2 years prior to admission. She presented with frequent episodes of hypoglycemia causing tachycardia, sweating, and neuroglycopenic symptoms, including confusion, dizziness, and blurred vision. These symptoms occurred during the day and night and impacted her work and quality of life negatively. 

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) with Dexcom G4 PLATINUM for seven days, which revealed ample blood glucose excursions throughout the day with glucose peaks above 200 mg/dL after meals, followed by a rapid fall below 55 mg/dL. CGM also showed low glucose levels during the night, as demonstrated by significant time spent below 55 mg/dL. Based on the continuous glucose profile, the diagnosis of PBH was posed. Glucose variability indexes with coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) increased. 
The patient was prescribed a normocaloric high-fiber, low-carbohydrate index diet with multivitamin and mineral supplements to address deficiencies of vitamin D and iron. After nutritional therapy, the symptoms improved, but the patient continued to report early morning asthenia and tiredness, associated with glucose levels below 70 mg/dL. A starting dose of uncooked cornstarch, gradually increased from 30 g to 85 g over time, administered before going to bed, resulted in a remarkable reduction in glucose variability indexes and postprandial glycemic peaks.

Admitting Diagnosis: NVAF, hypertension, bradycardia requiring pacemaker implantation, and history of upper gastrointestinal bleed while on anticoagulation

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for LAA occlusion device implantation due to a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 3, for diastolic heart failure, age, and history of hypertension, and a HAS-BLED score of 4. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with transseptal access guided by TEE and fluoroscopy. During deployment of the Watchman device, pericardial staining was noted, and the device was deployed with sheath remaining in the same distal position given the concern for losing LAA access. Acute evacuation of approximately 1 L of blood was required due to LAA laceration, and two pericardial drains were placed. The patient was transfused with packed red blood cells and anticoagulation was reversed with protamine. Despite reversal of anticoagulation, continuous pericardial drainage was required. The decision was made to deploy the Watchman device in the LAA to provide an impediment to blood loss. Following device deployment, there was an almost immediate cessation of fluid accumulation in the pericardial space. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and transferred to intensive care unit for further monitoring. On POD 2, a TEE revealed trace pericardial effusion with adequate device position and no peri-device leak. The patient was subsequently extubated and discharged on POD 5. Follow-up CT of the chest at 1 month showed adequate positioning of the device without any evidence of extravasation or device-related thrombus.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to severely impairing dizziness and anemia.

Hospital Course:
Upon initial examination, the patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and had been treated with oral corticosteroids, methotrexate (MTX) 10 mg weekly, and/or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Her condition had been steady for 16 months, but she experienced multiple symptoms in the following 8 months, leading to hospital admission.

Laboratory results showed normocytic anemia, with hemoglobin (Hb) count of 34 g/L and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 138 mm/h. Additional tests showed rheumatoid factor of 223 IU/mL, anti-cyclic peptide containing citrulline of 885.6 RU/mL, and vitamin B12 of 368 pmol/L. MTX was discontinued and glucocorticoids were administered for 12 weeks. However, the patient's hemoglobin level declined to 32 g/L, and additional red blood cell transfusions were required.

Re-examination revealed dysplastic features on hematopoietic lineages on bone marrow aspiration, leading to a diagnosis of treatment-related myelodysplastic syndrome (t-MDS). The patient's medical history and laboratory parameters suggested MTX was responsible for bone marrow toxicity. Tocilizumab was added to the treatment regimen, which resulted in clinical benefit and improvement in the patient's symptoms. The patient was discharged from the hospital after one month of treatment.

Follow-up visits showed no obvious abnormalities in the patient's laboratory results and bone marrow aspiration results.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to blurred vision in his right eye for 1 year. He was diagnosed with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) in the left eye 10 years prior, which was treated with argon laser photocoagulation. Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed retinal detachment accompanied with yellowish, fibrinoid exudative lesions in the temporal macula. An ophthalmic B scan confirmed bullous retinal detachment in the right eye, while fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) disclosed multiple intense sub-retinal leakage in areas corresponding to exudative lesion and in the superior retina. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) revealed large amounts of sub-retinal fluid (SRF) in the macular and temporal retinal areas.

Treatment:
The patient received a 50% dose of verteporfin photodynamic therapy (PDT) with three spots in the right eye under the guidance of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Ophthalmic B scan disclosed reduction in bullous retinal detachment 1 month after PDT, and the patient's BCVA improved to 20/25. Although the OCT image revealed a reduction in sub-retinal fibrin, the SRF remained and resolved slowly until the second month after PDT. Therefore, the patient received a second 50% dose of verteporfin PDT in the right eye with a spot size of 5000 μm under the guidance of ICGA. One month after the second PDT, ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed the disappearance of the yellowish, fibrinoid exudative lesions. Additionally, the reattached retina was observed on B-scan, and SRF in the temporal area markedly decreased in the OCT image.

Results:
OCT revealed nearly resolved SRF 2 months after the second PDT, and the SRF was completely resolved 3 months after the second PDT. The patient's BCVA of the right eye improved to 20/20 in the third month after the second PDT and remained stable until the sixth month after the second PDT. No recurrence occurred during the follow-up of more than 6 months after the second PDT.

Diagnosis:
- Blurred vision in the right eye
- Retinal detachment with yellowish, fibrinoid exudative lesions in the temporal macula
- Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) in the left eye

Condition at Discharge:
The patient's condition has significantly improved, as evidenced by the disappearance of the yellowish, fibrinoid exudative lesions and the nearly resolved sub-retinal fluid. The patient's BCVA in the right eye improved to 20/20 and remained stable until the sixth month after the second PDT. The patient is discharged in stable condition without any complications.

Follow-up:
The patient is recommended to follow up with his ophthalmologist for regular check-ups and to report any changes in his vision. The patient is advised to avoid smoking and alcohol consumption, as these may worsen his ocular condition. The patient is also advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and to adhere to his prescribed medications.",,,0

Patient: 72-year-old female

Admission date: [Insert]

Discharge date: [Insert]

Reason for admission: Ultrasound evaluation of the liver secondary to worsening liver function tests

Summary of hospital course:

The patient was admitted due to worsening liver function tests and a subsequent ultrasound examination demonstrated a right hepatic lobe hypoechoic solid mass measuring 5.6 cm in transverse diameter. Further evaluation with a contrast-enhanced CT scan showed two heterogeneously enhancing or hyperdense masses containing central areas of diminished attenuation within segments 6 and 7 of the right hepatic lobe. Upon review of the patient's chart, a previous CT scan performed 10 years ago showed a mildly nodular liver surface but without any discrete mass being present. CT-guided biopsy of the larger mass showed pathology results consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

The patient's medical history included obesity and she had undergone sleeve gastrectomy 2 months ago. Her liver function tests had been slightly elevated in 2012, but had progressed by the time of the current presentation. The portal vein was noted to be diminutive with a transverse diameter of 9 mm and a large tortuous complex shunt was noted to arise from the portal vein bifurcation with connections to the left renal vein and descending along the aorta to communicate with the inferior vena cava at the level of the L2–3 vertebrae.

The patient is currently undergoing treatment for her disease and the final outcome is yet to be determined.

3159,"Hospital Course:
The Chinese 15-month-old boy presented to the Urology department of our tertiary care center with right flank pain. On examination, an abdominal ultrasound from the local hospital revealed multiple cystic lesions in both kidneys and magnetic resonance urography (MRU) indicated the possibility of a renal cyst (right) and calyceal diverticula on the left. The child was subsequently diagnosed with right renal cyst and calyceal diverticula on the other side after reliable evaluations.

Treatment:
A robotic-assisted procedure was planned which was performed on September 1, 2016. The procedure involved a three-arm da Vinci Robot, standard version, and five ports in the abdomen region were placed for the procedure. After carefully exposing the cyst and incising it, most of the cyst wall was excised and sent for histopathological examination. This was followed by a contralateral procedure on the right side in the same sitting, where the calyceal diverticula was unroofed completely without renal arterial clamping. Renorrhaphy was performed in two layers using the sliding-clip technique.

Outcome:
Operating time was 90 minutes, postoperative drainage from two drains was approximately 50 cc, and no prophylactic antibiotics were given before surgery. Intravenously administered cefodizime (1 g, twice a day) was given 48 hours after surgery for prophylactic purpose. His postoperative period was uneventful, and he was discharged on day five postoperatively. With a 1-year follow-up after surgery, the child did not have any complaints, and postoperative ultrasound images showed no hydrops or diverticulum associated with either kidney. 

Impression:
The patient's case was identified through the evaluation of multiple cystic lesions found in both the kidneys and a diagnosis of right renal cyst and calyceal diverticula on the left.
Robotic-assisted surgery was successfully performed in a same-day outpatient setting without any significant intraoperative or postoperative complications.

Admission Diagnosis:

Persistent left epigastric dull pain accompanied by chills and febrile, history of unintentional weight loss, and intermittent abdominal pain.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with fever and left upper abdominal pain. Laboratory test results indicated an elevated white blood cell count and highly sensitive C-reactive protein. Upper abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed diffuse hepatic disease, spleen abscess with inflammatory exudate, spleen calcification, thickening of the wall of the gastric fundus, and chronic inflammation of the inferior lobe of the left lung.

The patient underwent laparoscopic exploration and splenectomy. A histological examination of biopsies demonstrated obvious spleen enlargement, fibrosis, and necrosis of spleen parenchyma, presenting as “frozen” lesions. Additionally, the tail of the pancreas and greater curvature of the stomach adhered to the spleen. The patient was treated with antibiotics intravenously for 15 days. Based on analyses of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), the isolated strain was susceptible to ceftazidime, meropenem, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX).

After hospitalization, the patient exhibited a gradual improvement in clinical condition. Upper abdominal CT showed minor pneumoperitoneum and a reduction in pleural fluid in the left lung lobe. The pigtail was removed after no further abscess drainage was necessary. The patient was asymptomatic for the next 5 days, and the wound was clean and granulating.

Patient Name: [redacted]
DOB: [redacted]

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to our facility at the age of 2 months with a lump on her left thigh, which had progressively grown after birth. The lesion was first described on the prenatal ultrasound at 30 weeks of gestation, and the patient was delivered by cesarean section due to fetal distress but was otherwise normal at birth. Development was normal, and there was no relevant family history. 

Upon physical examination, a 25/10 mm nodule was found on the antero-intern side of the left thigh that was firm, mobile and within the deep layers. The initial X-ray and ultrasound showed a pre-femoral soft tissue mass that measured approximately 30/13 mm, with nonhomogeneous structure, hypoechoic areas, calcifications, and weak Doppler signal, being located anteriorly to the vascular elements of the thigh. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a mass of 19.33/15.19/34 mm, with a nonspecific vascular involvement.

Elective surgery was scheduled, and an italic S-shaped incision on the antero-internal face of the left thigh was performed. The tumor was resected, and the sartorius muscle was resected at a distance of about 2 cm distal and proximal to the tumor, with complete tumor resection. The patient had a favorable surgical outcome and was discharged 3 days postoperatively.

Diagnostic Findings:

Histologically, the mass in the sartorius muscle was noted as a proliferation of tapered cells arranged in an irregular spiral pattern and crossed by thin-walled vessels. A pseudocapsule formed by a thin layer of connective tissue <1 mm covered the mass. Neoplastic proliferation encompassed residual skeletal muscle fibers in the center of the lesion. Extracapsular and peripheral scarce mature adipose tissue were seen with isolated large-caliber blood vessels. 

Immunostaining revealed the following results: vimentin positive, smooth muscle actin positive in nodules with necrosis and calcifications (miotic nodules), desmin focal positive, Ki67 low (about 5 positive cells per 100 tumor cells, suggesting low cell kinetics).

Diagnosis:

A diagnosis of IM of left sartorius muscle was made.

Patient Name: [name]
Sex: Female
Age: 64
Admission Date: [date]
Discharge Date: [date]

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient was admitted to the emergency unit with complaints of headache and fever for one week. She reported pain over her whole skull without any specific trigger point. Cranial and peripheral neurologic function did not have any impairment. There was no nausea, vomiting, blurred vision, or nuchal stiffness.

MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient denied drug or alcohol abuse.

FINDINGS:
Laboratory examination disclosed a normocytic anemia. Blood chemistry tests revealed abnormally elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. Chest X-ray routine film showed no active lung lesions. A computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head was ordered to rule out intracranial abscess or other central nervous system problems.

DIAGNOSIS:
Multiple osteolytic lesions were detected in the skull, and subsequent immunofixation electrophoresis analysis of serum did not show any evidence of monoclonal gammopathy. Levels of serum tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) were meaningfully increased in concentration but levels of cancer antigen 19-9 (CA 19-9) and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) were within normal limits. A CT scan of chest and abdomen revealed osteosclerotic and osteolytic lesions similar to that of skull involving almost the whole skeleton but not a single clear-cut primary tumor site could be located. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy were performed on the right side, posterior superior iliac crest, which revealed a metastatic adenocarcinoma.

TREATMENT:
Due to concern about the risk of fracture, the patient began to take tamoxifen, 20 mg twice daily. The effect seemed very satisfactory. After a period of probable “tamoxifen flare” with elevation of serum CA 15-3 and alkaline phosphatase levels for six weeks, both of them dropped gradually within four months (). Serum CA15-3 was within normal limits at the last follow-up. Positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) scans during the treatment course confirmed an impressive improvement of the bone marrow uptake. The mild activity remained in the lumbar spine could be either residual metastasis or, more favored by us, compensatory hyperactive hematopoiesis in its recovery phase (). 

SUMMARY:
The patient was diagnosed with metastatic adenocarcinoma due to the osteolytic lesions found on a CT scan of the skull. The patient was started on tamoxifen, 20 mg twice daily, which had a satisfactory effect. After a period of probable “tamoxifen flare” with elevation of serum CA 15-3 and alkaline phosphatase levels for six weeks, both of them dropped gradually within four months. Serum CA15-3 was within normal limits at the last follow-up. PET/CT scans during the treatment course confirmed an impressive improvement of the bone marrow uptake. The patient did not have headache or fever anymore and was discharged in stable condition.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:
The patient was advised to follow-up with her physician regularly for further assessment and treatment. Additionally, it is recommended that the patient continues taking tamoxifen as prescribed. The patient was advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle and exercise regularly to improve overall health. The patient was also advised to report any new symptoms that occur during the course of her treatment.",,,0

Reason for admission: Left hypochondriac pain and abdominal distention.

Hospital course:
The patient, a 40-year-old Malay male, presented with a one-week history of left hypochondriac pain accompanied by abdominal distention. He also complained of feeling lethargic and loss of appetite for one month. The patient had no fever, nausea, vomiting, changes in bowel habits, or history of bleeding diathesis. There was no history of trauma, past medical history, or family history of malignancy. The patient was an active smoker for 20 years but denied any alcohol consumption or substance abuse.

Upon admission, the patient appeared pale with an elevated heart rate of 110 beats per minute and a blood pressure measurement of 121/79 mmHg. Abdominal examination revealed enlarged, non-tender liver and spleen, and there was no ascites or peripheral lymphadenopathy. Haematological investigation revealed a low haemoglobin level (6.4 g/dl) with a white cell count (WCC) of 33.3 × 10^3 /uL and a platelet count of 568 × 10^3 /uL. Further diagnostic tests revealed an increase in lactate dehydrogenase levels (LDH) from 534 to 666 u/L. The patient reluctantly underwent an explorative laparotomy, which confirmed the presence of a diffused large B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). The lymphoma is of the non-germinal center B-cell (non-GCB) type. 

The patient was discharged thirteen days later, following explorative laparotomy. The patient was provided with prophylactic meningococcal, pneumococcal, and influenza vaccinations.

Patient: [Name], Female, Age 26

Diagnosis:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to short stature, learning disabilities, and reduced fat in the arms, legs, and gluteal region. The patient had primary hypothyroidism that was treated with levothyroxine. The selective loss of subcutaneous fat tissue in limbs, gluteal region, and abdomen became evident over time, leading to the diagnosis of lipodystrophy. The patient also had moderate hepatomegaly, umbilical hernia, hypertriglyceridemia, acanthosis nigricans, and skin biopsies revealed localized scleroderma (morphea). The patient was later diagnosed with diabetes and albuminuria.

Hospital Course:
During her hospital stay, the patient's thyroid function tests revealed severe primary hypothyroidism. She was treated with levothyroxine, resulting in her catch-up growth and normal pubertal development with menarche by age 14.8. After hypothyroidism treatment, the selective loss of subcutaneous fat tissue in limbs, gluteal region, and abdomen became evident over time. At age 13, hypochromic and atrophic cutaneous plaques were observed distributed throughout the body. Skin biopsies revealed localized scleroderma (morphea). 

At age 23, the patient was diagnosed with diabetes and albuminuria. Currently, the patient is 26 years old and presents with uncontrolled diabetes, hepatomegaly, and irregular menses. Standard serum determinations were performed, which are listed in the table below. The patient also shows a slight degree of intellectual impairment.

Hospital Course:

A 76-year-old Caucasian female presented to the emergency department with acute exacerbation of left-sided shoulder pain. Upon initial workup, a diagnosis of chronic degenerative joint disease of the shoulder and hip joints was made, and she was discharged home after an intra-articular steroid injection. However, the patient returned to the ED within two weeks with fatigue, malaise, and progressive proximal muscle weakness. She also exhibited upper eyelid edema and a periorbital violaceous rash, suggestive of a systemic illness.

Given her clinical presentation, a suspicion of dermatomyositis (DM) was considered. A chest CT scan revealed interstitial lung disease but no malignancy. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was ordered to evaluate the possibility of Lyme disease (LD) due to its increased prevalence in WI. Antibodies including anti-cyclic citrulline peptide antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, and anticardiolipin IgA and IgM were positive, but anti-JO-1 antibody was negative.

The physical exam showed symmetric pelvic and shoulder girdle weakness, positive heliotrope rash, and positive malar rash involving both nasolabial folds. Moreover, a macular erythematous rash of extensor surface of forearms and generalized cutaneous erythema with edema involving the abdominal wall were present. A widely distributed erythema of the upper neck, extending to the upper back and upper shoulders, indicating a “Shawl sign” was also noted.

Given the suspicion of LD, the patient was started on IV ceftriaxone as empiric treatment. After receiving the antibiotic, the patient appeared toxic, became hypotensive, and developed high-grade fever. However, the worsening of cutaneous lesions was not observed. Blood cultures were drawn due to clinical deterioration, and she received fluid resuscitation. She was transferred to the ICU for close monitoring.

Two target-shaped lesions were noted on her left scapula, which were highly suggestive of LD-related erythema migrans (EM) and were not previously reported or observed. Further evaluation was performed, and the patient was started on IV doxycycline due to her deteriorating condition. The patient responded promptly to antibiotic treatment, with fever and hypotension resolving. Antiborrelial treatment was continued for five days, and no further adjustments were needed.

After treatment, the patient's DM-like presentation showed an improvement in skin lesions and muscle strength, and she required no steroids or immunosuppressants. No DM workup including EMG, skin biopsy (SB), or muscle biopsy (MB) was performed. Given her recovery with antiborrelial treatment, DM-like features were attributed to the LD. She was discharged in stable condition with oral doxycycline for two weeks. On her post-discharge follow-up, she showed no recurrent signs or symptoms of LD or DM-like clinical features. Six months after the completion of treatment, she remained in remission without recurrence of her symptoms.

Discharge Diagnosis:

1. Lyme disease
2. Erythema migrans
3. Dermatomyositis-like presentation

Discharge Instructions:

1. Continue the course of oral doxycycline as prescribed.
2. Follow-up with your primary care physician for ongoing care.

Hospital Course: 
The patient, a 55-year-old Caucasian woman, presented with a 5-month history of abdominal pain and vomiting. She was initially diagnosed with a probable high-grade ovarian malignancy with a large volume of peritoneal disease. A CT scan showed a large right ovarian tumor, peritoneal tumor deposits, and ascites. Following a core biopsy, it was determined that she had high-grade serous adenocarcinoma that was consistent with an International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage III ovarian cancer. The patient was recommended for neoadjuvant chemotherapy prior to surgical debulking and commenced on a first cycle of the commonly used platinum-based two-drug chemotherapy regime of paclitaxel and carboplatin. The patient reported feeling better 1 day after chemotherapy. However, 3 days following the commencement of chemotherapy, persistent diarrhea developed. On the sixth day post-chemotherapy, she became febrile and acutely unwell with severe abdominal pain. Blood tests revealed that she had neutropenia, and a repeat CT showed a thickened descending colon and rectal pneumatosis with perforation into the mesorectum. Blood cultures were positive for Escherichia coli and meropenem was commenced. The patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for hemodynamic support due to septic shock. Despite treatment, the patient did not recover and passed away 9 days after the administration of the first dose of chemotherapy.

1239,"Hospital Course Summary:

This is a hospital course summary for a 63-year-old male patient who presented to the hospital with asymptomatic gross hematuria. The patient was diagnosed with a hypervascular tumor affecting the right kidney, measuring 10 cm in diameter with tumor thrombus towards the inferior vena cava (IVC) - clinical staging T4N1M1.

Treatment:

Initially, the indication of cytoreductive nephrectomy was questionable, and the patient was administered presurgical axitinib treatment. The patient received one-month treatment, which achieved shortened tumor thrombus and shrinkage of the primary site. However, liver invasion progressed, and lung and intramuscular metastases were controllable. The dose of axitinib was increased, but liver infiltration was revealed to be worsening at the two-month follow-up. Therefore, a decision was made to consider immediate surgical intervention with en bloc right nephrectomy and hemihepatectomy.

Perioperative PVE:

Before initiating the scheduled surgery, we performed a preoperative test to determine the liver's health status and estimate the allowed resected liver volume. The indocyanine green retention rate at 15 minutes (ICGR15) was 5.7%, and the comprehensive evaluation of liver function was Child-Pugh grade A. The estimated resected liver volume was 921 cm3 (71% of the whole liver), and perioperative PVE was performed to preserve residual liver volume and function after right lobectomy (including invaded tumor) in consideration of chemotherapy-induced liver functional deterioration and the high risk of major hepatectomy.

Liver Resection:

The patient was placed in the left hemilateral position, and thoracoabdominal incision was made via the 9th intercostal space, accompanied by an upper abdominal midline incision. The urological surgeons first mobilized the ascending, transverse colon, and duodenum, and the right renal artery was dissected at the interaortocaval region. Intraoperative ultrasound examination revealed that a shortened tumor thrombus remained within the renal vein, and right renal vein dissection. The right hepatic artery and portal vein were ligated and divided after confirmation of tumor invasion into the liver. Liver transection at the midline of the liver was easily achieved under intermittent hepatic inflow occlusion (three sessions at 15-minute intervals) and continuous hemiclamp of the infrahepatic vena cava through the maintenance of central venous pressure at 8 mmHg. After hepatic parenchymal transection exposing vena cava, the right hepatic veins were safely transected using vascular stapler. Finally, urological surgeons performed partial resection with direct closure of vena cava infiltrated by the tumor under good operative view and eventually achieved combined resection of right kidney and right liver.

Outcome:

The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery with no hepatic or urinary complications and has remained free of local recurrence and any de novo metastasis for 18 months. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment was initiated one month after surgery.

Pathological Findings:

The tumor was composed of atypical polygonal cells (Fuhrman grade 2) with clear cytoplasm proliferating mainly in a solid or nested fashion and papillary architecture was also observed in part of the tumor. The pathological findings were compatible with clear cell RCC. The tumor cells infiltrated directly to the renal vein, renal pelvis, right adrenal gland, and the liver. Necrosis was observed in approximately 50% of the tumor with the organization of obstructed medium-sized vessels, suggesting the effect of presurgical treatment. The apparent infiltration of cancer cells to vena cava was not observed.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Abnormal placentation at 29 weeks of gestation

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 32-year-old G5P4 woman, was admitted to our Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology due to a diagnosis of abnormal placentation during a routine ultrasound at 29 weeks of gestation. She had a history of previous cesarean delivery due to placenta previa. High precision clinical diagnosis of invasive placentation was conducted. An elective cesarean section was scheduled for 36 weeks of gestation. After exploratory laparotomy, the intra-abdominal findings showed an array of invasive placentation within the lower uterine segment. After initial bladder displacement, a transverse uterine incision was proceeded above the lower section of the uterus by avoiding the placental bed. A healthy baby girl of 5 pounds, 8 ounces was delivered. However, the patient had severe hemorrhage, and an immediate cesarean hysterectomy was performed. The placenta penetrated only up to the myometrium and reached the serosa to some extent, along with the formation of several hematomas on the bladder mucosa. The estimated blood loss was 6 L, and six units of whole blood and 1500 mL of free-frozen plasma (FFPs) were transfused. The patient's Foley's catheter was retained for 5 days. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was discharged on the sixth postoperative day in favorable recovery conditions.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient is a 58-year-old non-smoking female with a history of recurrent papillary thyroid cancer, breast cancer, and liver metastases of unclear origin. She was admitted to the medical intensive care unit due to persistent seizures requiring intubation for airway protection. Brain MRI revealed multifocal white matter edema affecting the occipital and parietal lobes with patchy gadolinium enhancement, predominantly affecting the posterior distribution, but also with frontal lobe lesions with associated vasogenic edema and patchy enhancement. A small acute infarct in the left centrum semiovale on diffusion-weighted imaging was also noted. She developed a fever early in her hospitalization, and extensive workup for infectious causes revealed right lower lobe pneumonia treated with vancomycin and cefepime. Her cerebrospinal fluid studies were not consistent with signs of meningitis or systemic vasculitis.

Based on her clinical findings, a presumed diagnosis of PRES was made, and the patient was treated accordingly. She also developed stress cardiomyopathy with tachycardia, and was started on captopril and metoprolol. However, ultimately, a decision was made for the patient to stop using lenvatinib and continue with lacosamide for epilepsy management. Despite her improved clinical condition, the patient's cancer progression resulted in non-resolving lactic acidosis without systemic signs of poor organ perfusion. The patient was advised to follow up with oncology and neurology for continuation of care.

Patient: 63-year-old female with super morbid obesity and medical history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus type 2, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diastolic heart failure.

Admission: Patient presented for an open reduction internal fixation (ORIF) of an ankle fracture.

Hospital Course:

The patient underwent general anesthesia for the surgery and was evaluated for peripheral nerve blockade by the Acute Pain Service. Due to the many, serious medical conditions of the patient, a peripheral nerve block was chosen to provide optimal postoperative analgesia. The surgery and nerve blocks were performed without any complication and the patient reported complete resolution of her ankle pain shortly after the blocks were done.

However, approximately 6 hours after surgery, the patient reported new pain on the operative leg which was treated with intravenous hydromorphone as tourniquet compression pain. Later it was noted that a hematoma had developed in the mid-thigh region. Interventions such as blood transfusion, computed tomography angiogram, and embolization coil and gel foam were carried out to manage the hematoma. On POD 2, consultation from vascular surgery and interventional radiology was sought for possible hematoma evacuation versus drain placement. On POD 3, Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was administered through the catheter placed in the hematoma to facilitate its drainage. She was discharged to a rehabilitation facility with the drain in place and care team instructions to flush 5-10 ml saline twice daily until evaluation with interventional radiology one week later. Until POD 26, the drain was replaced twice and aspirated fluid was sent for culture, which showed growth of staphylococcus aureus. The patient was treated with a five-day course of levofloxacin and when she returned in two weeks, abscess had resolved and the drain was removed.

Discharge:

The patient is being discharged with a recommendation of continued antibiotics and care for the complete resolution of the hematoma and superinfection.

Admission Diagnosis: Lower abdominal pain
Discharge Diagnosis: Adrenal myelolipoma

Hospital Course:
A 70-year-old female patient was admitted with complaints of lower abdominal pain that had been present for the past 5 months. She reported constipation and reported that the pain had steadily worsened over time, requiring management with narcotics. On presentation, she had urinary retention that led to the placement of an indwelling Foley catheter which revealed hematuria in the bag. The patient reported anorexia, nausea, abdominal bloating, and worsening of bilateral leg edema but did not exhibit vomiting, hematemesis, chest pain, melena, jaundice, fever, chills, night sweats, or weight loss. A CT scan showed a large heterogeneous but predominantly fatty pelvic mass compressing the bowel and bladder. Two needle core biopsies were done which revealed only benign adipose tissue. Patient was sent for upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopies and MRI. An MRI showed a 13 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm pelvic mass that appeared well encapsulated and nested between the rectosigmoid and sacrum. There was no suspicious lymphadenopathy. The patient underwent bilateral ureteral stent placement followed by resection of a large 18 cm sacrococcygeal tumor with en-bloc low anterior rectosigmoid resection and Hartmann’s stump.

Final Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with adrenal myelolipoma based on the histopathological analysis of the tumor tissue.

Summary of Treatment:
The patient underwent bilateral ureteral stent placement followed by resection of a large 18 cm sacrococcygeal tumor with en-bloc low anterior rectosigmoid resection and Hartmann’s stump.

Discharge Diagnosis: Benign lesion in the right retromolar area related to the lower right third molar
Hospital Course:

Admission:
The patient was referred for a consultation due to a painless mass in the right retromolar area that had developed a few weeks ago. The medical and dental history showed that the patient had undergone an excision of moderately differentiated mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the upper right posterior molar region in 2015. A hemimaxillectomy was carried out, along with reconstruction using a Free Fibular Flap (FRF) of the iliac crest.

Course:
On oral examination, an exophytic, mostly pedunculated lesion, with irregular granulomatous appearance and elastic consistency on the lower right retromolar area related to a partially erupted lower right third molar was detected. The radiographic investigation did not show any bone resorption at the site of the lesion. 

Routine blood tests were carried out, and exclusion of dysplasia was performed by cold-blade incisional biopsy. Contributing triggering factors were also eliminated. A decision was made to excise the lesion by CO2 laser under local anesthesia, and to extract the lower right third molar which might have caused chronic irritation.

Post-Operative:
The histological examination revealed a benign lesion with vascular structures and diffuse inflammatory infiltrate of granulocytes and neutrophils. No post-operative complications were observed.

Patient Name: [Name]
Age: 46
Sex: Female
Diagnosis: Schwannoma, Cognard IIa+b Dural Arteriovenous Fistula

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with symptoms of right ear congestion, pulsatile tinnitus, and mild hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a lobulated mass at the cerebellopontine angle. An Octreoscan was performed, which showed intense tracer uptake in the mass, thereby supporting the diagnosis of paraganglioma. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was conducted, which demonstrated a lack of vascularity associated with the tumor. However, it revealed an incidental discovery of a Cognard IIa+b dural arteriovenous fistula in the right posterior fossa. Due to the extensive volume of the tumor, the patient underwent a staged surgical resection.
The first surgery included a modified radical right neck dissection, right superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection, as well as the initial approach to the tumor and partial extradural resection. One week later, the patient underwent the second stage surgery where the tumor was radically resected using a right transcochlear approach. The right sigmoid sinus was ligated. The facial nerve was mobilized and transposed. Postoperative MRI confirmed complete resection of the tumor. Histological analysis of samples from both surgeries confirmed the tumor not to be a paraganglioma, but instead a schwannoma.
The patient had a long recovery from the surgery due to the lower cranial nerve palsies but has shown gradual improvement. Her latest follow-up MRI showed no evidence of recurrent tumor. DSA revealed large feeders from the right middle meningeal artery (MMA) and occipital arteries into the residual dural arteriovenous fistula. The fistula was embolized utilizing Onyx in the right MMA. Final right common carotid artery (CCA) angiogram demonstrated resolution in arteriovenous shunting. Vertebral artery injection after embolization demonstrated minimal residual shunting via the right anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA). Further intervention was declined by the patient, and angiographic follow-up in one year has been scheduled.

The patient was admitted to our hospital for further investigation of a right breast mass that was noticed during routine breast examination. The patient had a medical history of early gastric cancer and early esophageal cancer, and a family history of breast cancer and gastric cancer. Mammography showed a 1.5-cm coarse heterogeneously high-density calcified lesion at the upper outer portion of the right breast. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass containing multiple calcifications with relatively smooth borders.

Fine-needle aspiration cytology of the tumor showed small clusters of either normal or benign epithelial cells without any marked atypia. Since no malignancy was noted, a core needle biopsy was not performed. However, the patient was followed up regularly.

About 8 months later, mammography revealed a slight enlargement of the coarse calcification, but US showed the same size tumor. About 13 months after the first medical examination, the mass had grown to 2.3 cm in size, and after another 3 months, it had grown to 4.5 cm, and new coarse calcifications that were irregular in shape and different in density from the initial one appeared around the enlarged original coarse calcified tumor on mammography.

MRI showed a 4.5-cm mass at the upper outer portion of the right breast. A core needle biopsy showed a nodule with bone formation that was not malignant. The pathology report showed extraskeletal osteosarcoma of the breast.

Treatment and Management:
The patient received doxorubicin and ifosfamide (AI, three cycles) as adjuvant chemotherapy, and then underwent additional resection with latissimus dorsi flap reconstruction. She resumed AI (two cycles), but at 16 months from the first extirpation procedure, multiple lung metastases appeared, and her treatment was changed to doxorubicin and cisplatin (AP, two cycles).

Hospital Course:
The patient, an eight-year-old male with giant prolactinoma with extrasellar extension, presented in 2008 with progressive headache and visual disturbances. The patient was treated with high doses of cabergoline, resulting in normalization of prolactin and total tumor shrinkage. In 2013, the patient underwent transcranial excision of the tumor due to its resistance to cabergoline therapy and developed recurrent hypoglycemic episodes during the immediate postoperative period. Biochemical analysis confirmed this to be endogenous insulin dependent hypoglycemia. Imaging located a well-circumscribed lesion in the head of the pancreas, confirmed via histology as an insulinoma with benign characteristics. Six months after the pituitary surgery, the patient received three-field radiotherapy and continued on cabergoline resulting in declining prolactin levels. The patient's baseline echocardiography was normal. The patient is being evaluated for new onset primary hyperparathyroidism due to high calcium levels.

Later, the patient underwent transcranial excision of the tumor due to its resistance to cabergoline therapy and developed recurrent hypoglycemic episodes postoperatively, which was confirmed biochemically as endogenous insulin dependent hypoglycemia. An imaging revealed an insulinoma in the head of the pancreas, which was enucleated and confirmed histologically as benign. The patient underwent three-field radiotherapy and continued treatment with cabergoline resulting in declining prolactin levels. The patient is being evaluated for new onset primary hyperparathyroidism due to high calcium levels.",,,0

Patient Name: N/A
Medical Record Number: N/A

Hospital Course:

The patient was transferred to the Ulsan University Hospital due to severe abdominal pain accompanied by right flank pain. On admission, the patient had been previously healthy and had no specific medical or surgical history. She had an irregular menstruation cycle, and her last menstruation occurred five weeks and six days previously. Blood tests showed a low hemoglobin level, and a urinary pregnancy test was positive, with the serum β-HCG level being elevated. 

Gynecological sonography revealed no evidence of an intrauterine pregnancy, except for normal bilateral adnexa with free fluid collection, suggestive of hemoperitoneum. The patient was planned for abdominopelvic computed tomography (APCT) to determine the cause of the right flank pain. The findings of APCT revealed a hypervascular mass in the subphrenic region, with a moderate amount of hemoperitoneum, which was thought to be the cause of the bleeding. 

Because of suspicions of a diaphragmatic ectopic pregnancy or other ruptured unknown hepatic mass, she was admitted for emergency surgery. Diagnostic laparoscopic surgery was performed, and approximately 400 mL of blood and clots were aspirated from the pelvic cavity. A tissue, suspected to be the placenta with a hematoma, had covered the diaphragm. After the removal of the placenta-like tissues, a hypervascular mass attached to the diaphragm was found. The mass was completely resected from the diaphragm and sent for histological examination. 

After the surgical mass removal, the patient was discharged without any postoperative complications. The final pathologic diagnosis indicated that the mass was a product of conception, consistent with an ectopic pregnancy. 

Discharge Diagnosis:

- Ectopic pregnancy

Discharge Instructions:

- Follow up with your primary care physician for further care.
- Take prescribed medications as directed by your healthcare provider.
- Avoid strenuous physical activity until cleared by your healthcare provider.
- Report any abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, or dizziness to your healthcare provider immediately.

Admission and Hospital Course:
The patient was diagnosed with a respiratory infection and conjunctivitis. He presented with fever, coughing spells, and purulent conjunctivitis, among other symptoms. Sputum and conjunctival culture showed nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae that was susceptible to levofloxacin and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Antimicrobial therapy was started, and the patient was treated with levofloxacin 500 mg/day, ciprofloxacin eye drops as needed, acetaminophen, and guaifenesin. The patient received humidification of his trachea and the airway via repeated insertions of respiratory saline and by breathing humidified air. The patient experienced repeated episodes of sustained elevated blood pressure and tachycardia, which were managed by clonidine 0.1 mg as needed. The patient's fever declined 48 hours after antimicrobial therapy was started. The conjunctivitis improved within 36 hours. The sputum production declined and became less viscous over time, but persisted for 5 days. The patient had a complete recovery in 7 days.

Patient Name: N/A
Sex: Female
Age: 45
Date of Discharge: N/A

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to our hospital with multiple lung nodules and a history of poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy and central neck lymph node dissection, which revealed capsular invasion and extensive vascular space invasion.

After histological examination of the primary thyroid tumor and lung nodules, the diagnosis was revised to a biphasic malignant tumor consisting of both carcinoma and sarcoma components. The thyroid carcinoma component was positive for thyroglobulin, PAX8, and TTF1, whereas the sarcoma component was positive for vimentin and myogenin.

The patient received chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy. However, her thyroglobulin levels rose, suggesting a progression of the disease. A right thoracotomy and right lung resection/metastasectomy were performed, with negative surgical margins. Nevertheless, the patient's general condition deteriorated, and she succumbed to the disease four months later.

Findings:
The lung nodules showed similar tumor morphology and differentiation as the original thyroid tumor. Mutational analysis revealed the presence of a point mutation in DICER1 (E1705K), which has been associated with differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

Other mutations detected in the tumor included FLCN (R239H), POLD1 (Q684H), and SYK (R217L), which have unclear prognostic and therapeutic significance in this context.

Conclusion:
The patient had a complex clinical history, with multiple lung nodules and a biphasic malignant thyroid carcinoma. Despite treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, leading to her passing four months after surgical intervention. Further studies are needed to understand the significance of the genetic mutations identified.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The patient is a 55-year-old incarcerated male who presented to the emergency department with left-sided scrotal pain and swelling. The patient's medical history includes prostate cancer, high-grade urothelial bladder cancer, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's therapy course included a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, intravesical mitomycin, interferon alfa-2b, and intravesical BCG therapy. He received a total of seven intravesical injections of 50 mg live BCG per injection over the course of 18 months. The patient developed scrotal pain and was initially diagnosed with acute bacterial epididymitis and prescribed ciprofloxacin. However, he had no improvement in his symptoms despite treatment.
Evaluation of the testicle with ultrasound revealed multiple diffuse nodular areas of hypoechogenicity and marked hypervascularity involving all of the left-sided structures. Routine blood and urine cultures were negative, and mycobacterial blood and urine cultures, as well as bladder biopsy, were pending.
Antituberculous therapy was started based on the following considerations regarding the patient's presentation. The lack of observed response to ciprofloxacin therapy decreased the likelihood of uncomplicated bacterial orchitis. Possibly, his immunocompromised state secondary to the malignancy, in combination with mitomycin chemotherapy and immunomodulatory rheumatoid arthritis treatment, could have increased his susceptibility to a mycobacterial infection. Finally, as ultrasound findings were characteristic of BCG orchitis, the patient was promptly initiated on a combination therapy with levofloxacin, rifampin, isoniazid, and ethambutol. 
The patient showed marked improvement in pain control and testicular swelling over the following weeks.

Clinical Summary:
The patient is a 44-year-old right-handed man who was admitted to our clinic for radial-side pain associated with the left wrist. He has a history of playing golf and weight training, and the wrist pain had been present for 4 months. The patient received physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroid injections twice, but the pain was only temporarily relieved. The patient had no evidence of systemic diseases or trauma history.

Diagnostic Findings:
Upon examination, the patient's wrist showed mild swelling on the radial side, severe tenderness associated with the radial styloid process and moderate tenderness on the mid-dorsal aspect of the radio-carpal joint. He yielded positive results in Finkelstein's test and displayed limited range of motion of the left wrist. The visual analog scale (VAS) score for pain was 10 at rest. The initial plain left-wrist radiograph showed no abnormalities. MRI of the left wrist suggested mild tenosynovitis at the third extensor compartment and intersection syndrome. We clinically diagnosed him with de Quervain's disease and focal synovitis of radio-carpal joint. Upon performing diagnostic wrist arthroscopy and retinacular release of the first extensor compartment for de Quervain's disease, we observed dorsal synovitis, scapho-lunate and lunato-triquetral instability.

Operative Findings:
During the operation, we observed stenosing tenosynovitis at the second extensor compartment with partial tearing. We partially removed the hard bony protrusion. The oblique EPL tendon was found to originate from the ulnar side of the forearm to the radial styloid at the radial and proximal sites of Lister's tubercle. No EPB tendon was found.

Follow-up:
At 12 months follow-up, the patient was completely asymptomatic at the radial styloid process and able to resume full daily activities.

Impression:
Based on this patient's clinical and operative findings, we can conclude that the patient presented with de Quervain's disease and focal synovitis of radio-carpal joint. The presence of dorsal synovitis, scapho-lunate and lunato-triquetral instability was also observed during operative examination. No evidence of systemic diseases or trauma history was found.

Computed tomography showed a mixed-density mass with calcifications and a discontinuous border over her left adnexa, consistent with clinical suspicion of a ruptured teratoma. 

The patient's condition deteriorated rapidly, and she was initially suspected to have severe sepsis with acute kidney injury. Antibiotics were changed, and she underwent exploratory laparoscopy. Purulent fluid was found in her peritoneal cavity, and a ruptured teratoma was observed near her left adnexa. The surgery was challenging due to significant adhesions caused by active inflammation, and it was not possible to visualize or remove the ruptured cyst.

Post-surgery, the patient developed bilateral pleuritis with a bloody background, likely caused by the chemical irritation of the spilled contents of the teratoma. The patient's condition improved over the course of her hospital stay, although she experienced intermittent fever, mild abdominal pain, and sporadic shortness of breath for the following two weeks. Antibiotics were administered and adjusted according to culture results. The patient was discharged after 28 days with bilateral drains and detailed discharge instructions.

Discharge diagnosis:
Ruptured teratoma caused by puncture during TVOR

Treatment:
Exploratory laparoscopy, intra-abdominal lavage with antibiotics, bilateral drains, and administration of antibiotics

Follow-up:
The patient was advised to schedule a follow-up visit with her physician to monitor her recovery. The physician recommended that she avoid strenuous activity, maintain a healthy diet, and get plenty of rest. She was also advised to report any ongoing symptoms or concerns to her physician.",,,1

Hospital: [Hospital Name]

Clinical Information:

The patient was admitted to the hospital for the evaluation of an incidental FDG-avid right thyroid lesion following staging PET for colorectal carcinoma.

Hospital Course:

The patient underwent a right hemithyroidectomy which revealed a round solid well-circumscribed tan nodule with the absence of vascular invasion. Pathological examination showed formation of trabeculae and high nuclear cytoplasmic ratio in several areas. In addition, the PDTC-like focus and adjacent trabeculae region showed a higher proliferation rate by MIB1 immunohistochemical staining. These findings were suggestive of follicular thyroid neoplasm with a potential for aggressive behavior.

After multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a left completion thyroidectomy which was negative for adenoma or malignancy but showed features of lymphocytic thyroiditis.

Follow-up 12 months after the resection showed the patient to be alive and well.

Diagnosis:

Follicular thyroid neoplasm with a potential for aggressive behavior.

Treatment:

The patient underwent right hemithyroidectomy and left completion thyroidectomy.

Recommendations:

As the patient has features of lymphocytic thyroiditis, regular follow-up and monitoring will be needed to assess the overall thyroid function and whether hormonal replacement therapy is required.

The patient is advised to maintain regular follow-up appointments with her endocrinologist.

Brief Hospital Course:

A 24-year-old gravida-3-para-2 at 24 weeks’ gestation was referred to our department for TTTS. The patient underwent placental laser surgery under local anesthesia in the operating room. On postoperative day 3, an ultrasound examination revealed pleural effusion, ascites, increased nuchal thickness, oligohydramnios, tricuspid regurgitation, and negative ductus venosus A-wave in the donor twin and normal Doppler findings in the recipient twin. The indomethacin treatment was stopped. The direction of ductus venosus flow turned to positive on the next day and further examination revealed a 50% increase in the transverse diameter of the ductus arteriosus, and the ductal arch returned to its normal shape. The tricuspid regurgitation, ascites, and pleural effusion disappeared completely on postoperative days 5 and day 7, respectively. The patient was discharged on the tenth day postoperatively. 

Course of Treatment:

The complications and prognosis of TTTS and risks of placental laser surgery were discussed with the family, and the patient opted for placental laser surgery. The patient was administered 100mg indomethacin on the day of the operation due to regular uterine contractions as a rectal suppository once a day. Indomethacin administration was continued until postoperative day 2, and the contractions disappeared. 

Summary:

A 24-year-old female patient with diamniotic MC twin pregnancy was diagnosed with stage 3 TTTS during the 24th week of gestation.

Admitting Diagnosis: Epigastralgia

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department with complaints of epigastralgia with two weeks of evolution and aggravation last night. She denied another accompanying symptomatology. Objective examination showed tachycardia, confirmed on electrocardiogram. Analytically, had leukocytosis and eosinophilia and elevation of markers of myocardial necrosis. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction with ventricular septal hypocontractility and an increase in the concentric thickness of the ventricular walls. Valvular disease was not evident. Anti-ischemic therapy was started but coronary angiography did not reveal epicardial coronary disease. After this, the diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis in a patient with a known atopic component was likely. The patient was admitted to the hospital for treatment and study. Neuro-humoral, beta-blocker and diuretic therapy were initiated, maintaining aspirin. On the third day of hospitalization, cardiac magnetic resonance was performed which identified subepicardial foci of edema and late enhancement in the left ventricular myocardium and a small pericardial effusion in the free wall of the right ventricle. The ejection fraction was quantified. On the same day, she underwent an endomyocardial biopsy and collection of right ventricular infarct fragments, which confirmed the diagnosis of eosinophilic myocarditis. Systemic corticosteroid therapy was started with progressive improvement of general condition. On the 12th day of hospitalization, the echocardiogram showed a slight improvement in left ventricular global systolic function. She was discharged to home with prednisolone in weaning, and with follow-up consultation of cardiology and autoimmune diseases.

Discharge Diagnosis: Isolated growth hormone deficiency due to a likely pathogenic-class 2 variant in the GHRH-R gene

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 13-month old female, was admitted due to failure to thrive, as a result of a history of intrauterine growth retardation and placental insufficiency. The patient had a normal karyotype, was not diagnosed with celiac disease or food allergy, and had normal renal function, thyroid and adrenal hormone levels. The patient demonstrated poor serum GH response and low IGF-1 levels, leading to a diagnosis of isolated growth hormone deficiency. After ten months of GH treatment, the patient demonstrated improvement in her clinical parameters.

The patient was investigated for Silver-Russell syndrome and 3M syndrome, but the presence of a novel homozygous nonsense variant in the GHRH-R gene, the c.97C>T (p.Gln33*) was found. The variant was detected in the mother's heterozygous form and it is suspected that a large deletion in the paternal allele is present.

Duration of Hospitalization: [Redacted]

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with bilateral adrenal nodules resulting in cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma, also known as Cushing's Syndrome (CS). Additionally, she was diagnosed with Kappa light chain Multiple Myeloma (MM) of stage I.

Hospital Course:

The patient complained of progressively worsening back and arm pain over 2 weeks. She came to the hospital with a medical history of occasional use of Chinese herbs and weight loss pills. She had a non-severe falling accident, which led to worsening back and right arm pain. Clinical examination revealed a rounded face, truncal obesity, purplish striae, and high blood pressure. Hypercortisolism was suspected.

The provisional diagnosis of ECS was confirmed by a 24-hour urine cortisol level, serum cortisol levels after dexamethasone suppression, and loss of physiologic diurnal variation. ACTH-independent CS was determined by an ACTH level. CT of the upper abdomen showed bilateral adrenal nodules. Adrenal venous sampling (AVS) revealed a predominantly left-sided ratio of adrenal venous to peripheral plasma cortisol. The patient also had a compression fracture of the T5-T10 vertebrae and osteolytic lesions in her ribs and pelvic bones, which resulted in the suspicion of metastatic cancers and MM.

Further diagnostic investigations revealed Kappa light chain MM, International Staging System stage I. The patient was prioritized for MM treatment using the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD) regimen. The treatment was recycled every 28 days with a total of six cycles, after which a very good partial response was achieved. An autologous stem cell transplant was performed.

Five months after the stem cell transplant, the patient underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy, where a left adrenal cortical adenoma was identified. She received a steroid replacement, which was gradually discontinued over 9 months. Her blood pressure decreased slowly, and she was successfully tapered off the anti-hypertensive drugs over 2 months. Her Cushingoid appearance gradually subsided, and she was in remission of both diseases after more than 30 months of treatment.

Outcome:

The patient was discharged upon achieving remission. She had a complete response to the intervention and was doing well at the time of discharge. Follow-up appointments were scheduled to monitor her progress.

Final Diagnosis:

Cortisol-producing adrenal adenoma
Multiple Myeloma of stage I. 

Treatment:

The patient was treated with the bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and dexamethasone (VCD) regimen and underwent autologous stem cell transplant. She then underwent left laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Steroid replacement was administered which was gradually discontinued over 9 months. Blood pressure medication was tapered off.

She should also maintain a healthy lifestyle, diet, and regular exercise. The patient was advised to notify the doctor in case of any unusual symptoms or discomfort.",,,1
2866,"Discharge Summary:

Patient demographics: 63-year-old male.

Chief complaint: Total laryngectomy due to recurrent laryngeal cancer.

Hospital course:

The patient was admitted to undergo total laryngectomy after a semi-laryngectomy eight months prior. He had a medical history of hypertension for 17 years and mild impairment of left ventricular diastolic function as defined by an echocardiogram. Upon examination, erythema and swelling were found under his right mandible with an erupted ulcer caused by the invasion of the tumor. The airway was evaluated and determined to be Malampatti grade III with normal mouth opening.

The patient's blood pressure was elevated at 180/95 mmHg, which was subsequently reduced to 130/80 mmHg following urapidil (25 mg). After the administration of 2% lidocaine (4 ml) to the tracheal and oropharyngeal areas, intravenous injection of midazolam (1 mg) and fentanyl (50 μg) was followed by fibroscope-guided nasal intubation. However, the larynx's structural deformation was noted, with impaired vocal cord mobility, leaving only a ""fissure"" of space, hindering the fibroscope's passage, even with a 2.8 mm diameter.

The patient then underwent tracheostomy under bilateral superficial cervical plexus block with assisted mask ventilation by 100% oxygen, followed by placement of a 7.0 mm coiled tracheal tube. General anesthesia was maintained by intravenous propofol and inhalational sevoflurane. Excision of the larynx revealed the distorted structure of the glottis with an S-shaped stenosis.

Summary of hospital stay:

The patient was successfully treated for total laryngectomy with tracheostomy under general anesthesia and recovered well after the surgery. The patient's vitals were monitored throughout the hospital stay, and no complications were reported. He was discharged with appropriate care instructions, including wound care and follow-up appointments with the treatment team.

Reason for Admission: Progressive lower limb paralysis and general fatigue    

Hospital Course: The patient was referred to our hospital due to progressive lower limb paralysis and general fatigue. She had a history of ONB and underwent skull base surgery and postoperative radiation therapy against ONB. On admission, the patient had a Cushingoid appearance, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. An elevated cortisol level, elevated ACTH level, and raised ProGRP level were also detected. Chest and abdominal computed tomography revealed no abnormality except for a new pulmonary nodule in the left lower lobe. Head and neck magnetic resonance imaging showed that there were no remarkable findings in the pituitary gland, and the ONB had increased in size in the right nasal cavity and the right ethmoid sinus over 3 years. The history and laboratory data appeared to be consistent with EAS, however, an obvious source was not apparent. Potassium supplement improved her symptoms, and she was planned to be admitted for further work-up and management for EAS, at a later date. One month after the referral, she was urgently hospitalized due to acute pleuritic chest pain on inspiration. Chest CT revealed left lower lobular consolidations with pleural effusion and a new pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe. Laboratory results revealed elevated levels of CRP and β-D-glucan. Her HIV screening was negative. Blood and sputum culture showed no remarkable findings. As evidence for Cushing’s syndrome, a raised cortisol level and ACTH level were also detected. The cortisol level was not suppressed by a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. The history and laboratory work-up suggested that her Cushing’s syndrome was more likely arising from EAS. Although treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam for pneumonia improved her pleuritic chest pain after 5 days, the pulmonary consolidation did not resolve. Histological examination of the transbronchial biopsy specimen and cytology of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed no evidence of malignancy or fungi. Two weeks later, the BALF culture was positive for Nocardia spp., identified as Nocardia cyriacigeorgica by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim improved her pulmonary lesions, as well as decreased the β-D-glucan level. Treatment with metyrapone and mitotane improved her plasma ACTH and cortisol levels. Scintigraphy performed using Octreoscan as an additional investigation for the origin of the EAS, revealed strong tracer uptake consistent with the ONB; however, there was no uptake in the lung. Moreover, histological specimens of the ONB resected 10 years earlier showed no evidence of intracytoplasmic immunopositivity of ACTH.


Condition at discharge: The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to continue oral sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim for more than 1 year since she was an immunocompromised host. The patient was also advised to follow-up with her primary care physician to continue monitoring her progress.

The patient was admitted for evaluation of increasing vertigo with bilateral murmer at his neck. He had a history of diabetes mellitus and hypertension. During the hospital stay, the patient underwent bilateral carotid color duplex Doppler examination which showed mild atherosclerotic plaques of the common carotid bifurcation without any hemodynamically significant stenosis. Cerebral MRI revealed chronic ischemic signal changes in pons and nonspesific signal changes in white mater of bilateral frontal lobes. Selective carotid and vertebral angiographies were performed in order to confirm the stenoses in proximal parts of both internal carotid arteries; occipital arteries were arising from the cervical segments of internal carotid arteries on both sides. Selective right vertebral angiography revealed the patency of the artery with hypoplasia of V3–V4 segments and intracranial and intervertebral collateral flow to the left vertebral artery. Left subclavian angiography prior to catheterization of vertebral artery demonstrated severe stenosis of the vertebral artery.

Treatment:

The patient received a baloon-expandable intravascular stent which was placed to the ostium of the left vertebral artery in order to treat the high grade stenosis.

This document serves as a summary of the hospital course for a 60-year-old male patient referred to our center for evaluation of ascites and increased liver enzymes. The patient had complained of fatigue and weight loss over the previous eight months and reported a history of alcohol consumption. Further examination revealed sarcopenia and ascites, and liver ultrasound showed a hepato-splenomegaly, hyperechoic liver parenchyma, and signs of intrahepatic portal hypertension. Transient elastography and 2D-shear wave elastography demonstrated high liver stiffness measurements, and a CT scan confirmed the imaging findings. The patient underwent a transjugular liver biopsy, which indicated a sinusoidal cause of portal hypertension due to massive amyloid deposition predominantly in the Dissé space. These findings led to a diagnosis of multiple myeloma with systemic primary amyloidosis and liver involvement.

Treatment:
The patient underwent four cycles of chemotherapy with the CyBorD scheme, which was well-tolerated despite the development of complications related to severe portal hypertension. Refractory ascites required multiple paracentesis, and the patient also experienced bacterial infections and hepato-renal syndrome. Despite these challenges, the patient achieved very good partial remission after four cycles of CyBorD.

Outcome:
The patient's fatigue, loss of appetite, and PNP gradually improved after completion of the chemotherapy. Although the patient initially refused further consolidation of first-line treatment with ASCT, his clinical condition improved gradually over a period of eighteen months, during which time he showed no signs of clinical decompensation of liver disease. One year later, the patient's clinical condition was fully stable, with significantly reduced liver and spleen stiffness measurements and improved ultrasound findings indicating a reduction in the size of the liver. These results suggest a favorable prognosis and a good response to treatment.

Upon arrival, she was in shock and immediately received antishock treatment. Her injuries included orthopedic injuries, pelvic floor contusions and lacerations, and extensive skin abrasions. Emergency consultations were performed with various departments for proper monitoring, wound dressing, and postoperative care. Consent was taken for her current treatment and multistage surgical treatment for her condition.

After successful general anesthesia, necrotic tissue was excised, intermittent sutures were performed for anal and perineal tear, and continuous suture was applied for the left abdominal wall large defect. A transverse colostomy was done and the abdominal cavity was closed. She received an intraoperative and postoperative blood transfusion.

Postoperatively, the patient received proper monitoring, ventilator support, antibiotic, electrolyte correction, nutritional support, rehydration, daily dressing, and other symptomatic and supportive treatment. She underwent physical and occupational therapy and rehabilitation training to improve her strength and ability to walk.

Upon examination, the amputation site wound measured 15 cm × 10 cm and had a yellowish graft exudate. The lateral side of the right thigh had a scab wound measuring approximately 10 cm × 10 cm. The right groin had a 20 cm × 5 cm abrasion, which was dry and healthy.

She complains of phantom limb pain, which is not responsive to analgesics, and is treated with methylcobalamin, occupational therapy, and rehabilitation training. She could wear prosthetic limbs but prefers not to due to inconvenience. She usually walks with a single crutch up to 100 m.

The 67-year-old female patient presented to the hospital with complaints of severe pain in the left anterior buccal vestibule and tightened upper lip after multiple dental implants were placed in the maxilla. Painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy was diagnosed based on clinical and radiological evaluations.

Treatment:
The patient was treated with Tegretol twice a day for 2 weeks, which helped relieve the symptoms, but the tightened pain on the bilateral sides of the nose persisted. The dose was increased for another 2 weeks, followed by another 2 weeks at the same dose. Although the frequency and severity of the pain decreased, side effects such as headache and dizziness occurred.

As a result, the patient was prescribed amitriptyline once a day before bedtime and capsaicin ointment locally applied to the site of the pain. A stent was created in the maxilla and capsaicin ointment was applied to the stent for 20 min, and the stent was to be worn three times a day. However, no improvement was noted, and the pain worsened.

The patient then received Neurontin three times daily and underwent electric acupuncture stimulation therapy (EAST) four times at 2-week intervals, but the burning and throbbing pain in the upper lip and tenderness of the palatal area persisted.

Afterward, medication was changed to Trileptal twice a day by prescribing 300 mg. Though there was a slight improvement, the patient persisted with persistent pain. In the upper part of the mucosa, 250 U of Dysport was injected, and, as a transient side effect, food was spilled due to the unnatural movement of the lips during mealtime, but the pain was significantly reduced.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient presented with a 3-month history of tightness in his bilateral flank region, weakness, difficulty walking requiring crutches, and unintentional 10-pound weight loss due to poor appetite, all of which progressed over time. The patient had a history of E-beta-thalassemia and splenectomy, but had stopped following up with his hematologist 8 years prior, reporting a baseline hemoglobin of 6 g/dL. On examination, the patient had bilateral costovertebral angle tenderness, slow broad-based gait with ambulation, decreased light touch sensation of the thorax at the level T7-T10, at left medial thigh, and in bilateral lower extremities below the knees. An MRI of the brain showed masses involving the clivus and medial occipital bone with mass extension into the bilateral maxillary/sphenoid sinuses, posterior aspect of ethmoid cells, bilateral maxillary bones, inferolateral orbits, and parietal calvarium. An MRI of the thoracic/lumbar spine showed significant stenosis, and the masses were found to be extramedullary hematopoietic elements. The patient was started on a PRBC transfusion to gradually increase baseline hemoglobin to above 10 g/dL along with hydroxyurea 15 mg/kg/day. Hydroxyurea was gradually increased to 2000 mg daily to achieve maximum possible hematopoiesis suppression. The patient regained gross sensation in his lower extremities 2 days after the initiation of treatment. After 1 week of hospitalization, gait had improved, and gross sensation of the thoracic area had returned. The patient subsequently graduated from physical therapy. By hospitalization day-14 when he was discharged, the patient had received a total of 6 units of PRBC. Hydroxyurea was maintained at 2000 mg daily without causing neutropenia or thrombocytopenia.

Admitting Diagnosis: Neurological disorder

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital after presenting to her general practitioner with a 2-day history of increasing right leg weakness. She was referred to her local hospital where she presented as no longer able to walk. An urgent MRI of the spine was undertaken that revealed no evidence of epidural collection or neural compression. She subsequently underwent a CT scan of the brain that demonstrated a dural-based lobulated, heavily calcified left parafalcine mass associated with extensive oedema consistent with a meningioma. An urgent transfer to a tertiary center occurred where further facilities were provided to study and treat her condition. The patient underwent a left frontoparietal craniotomy and resection of the lesion. Histology demonstrated a meningothelial meningioma, WHO grade I with focal areas of necrosis and features, raising the possibility of embolization-related changes. After receiving necessary treatment and brief inpatient rehabilitation, the patient was discharged home. At her 4-month review, she was walking with 5/5 power in hip and knee flexion and extension and 4/5 power in ankle dorsiflexion and plantaflexion. A 6-month follow-up MRI showed no recurrence.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for CABG treatment due to a history of diabetes and high cholesterol. Preoperative coronary angiography showed severe in-stent stenosis in the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD) and the diagonal branch. The surgical team conducted a left ITA (LITA)-LAD bypass and a right ITA (RITA) diagonal branch bypass using nicorandil and diltiazem during CABG for vasospasm prevention. After the CABG, the patient demonstrated stable circulation without electrocardiogram changes. However, transit time flow measurement indicated poor LITA graft flow despite re-anastomosis. The team immediately moved the patient to a hybrid operating room for further examination. Coronary angiography revealed vasospasms in the native coronary arteries. After intracoronary injections of verapamil and isosorbide dinitrate, the surgical team injected fasudil through the LITA, which effectively improved coronary flow through the LITA graft. Intra-aortic balloon pumping was subsequently applied to secure coronary blood flow. On postoperative day 1, the patient underwent coronary angiography and was shown to have a patent bypass graft with sufficient coronary runoff. The patient's peak postoperative CK, CK-MB, and troponin T levels were within normal ranges. The patient did not experience any vasospasm recurrence and was discharged on postoperative day 11.

Diagnosis and Procedures:
- CABG surgery 
- Vasospasms in the native coronary arteries

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 58-year-old woman who was admitted to the Nyakach County Hospital with edematous swelling of the face, dysphagia, and hoarseness of voice. The patient reported difficulty swallowing and had a swollen tongue that was wedged between her teeth, making it impossible for her to close her mouth. The initial examination revealed a pulse rate of 75 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, and blood pressure of 140/72 mmHg. Saliva was pooling and dribbling from the patient's mouth. The medical history of the patient was unremarkable, and no recent use of aspirin, NSAIDs or ACE inhibitors was found.

During the admission, the patient was suspected to have enalapril-induced angioedema. A preliminary diagnosis was made, and the patient was immediately discontinued from enalapril. Intravenous hydrocortisone and chlorpheniramine were administered, and the patient was observed for an hour. The edema was noted to subside, and a further three-hour observation period was allowed. The patient was then discharged on a once-daily dose of nifedipine, chlorpheniramine, and a tapered dose of prednisolone.

Current Status:

At the time of discharge, the patient's facial swelling had resolved, and the blood pressure was found to be 142/78 mmHg. The patient was advised to continue taking her usual doses of metformin, glibenclamide, and hydrochlorothiazide and to report to the hospital immediately if the swelling reoccurs.

The patient was admitted with a complaint of constipation for 5 days, followed by diarrhea with abdominal distension. Upon admission, she presented with extensive abdominal tenderness and a fecal occult blood test was positive. Serological markers for autoimmunity and viral serology were normal, as were stool examinations for bacteria and parasites.

Abdominal X-ray revealed multiple intraluminal gas pockets in the left colon, and colonoscopy revealed grape-like or beaded subepithelial lesions with erythematous mucosa distributed in the sigmoid. The endoscopic ultrasonography showed low echo of cystic below the mucosal layer.

High frequency electrosurgical resection of the gas cysts was performed but only partial treatment was necessary due to the risk of infection. The patient was placed on a restricted diet and given parenteral nutrition. Ornidazole and vitamin B2 were administered to regulate intestinal anaerobes, and bifidobacterium was given to aid in digestion.

One week later, the patient was able to consume a half-fluid diet. Her condition steadily improved over the next two weeks, with the lesions disappearing completely one month later.

Hospital Course:
The patient was diagnosed with Folliculotropic Mycosis Fungoides in 1997 and was treated with local chlormethine from 1998 to 2006. In 2006, the disease progressed to a tumoral form with infiltrating plaques and nodules all over the body, including an exophytic lesion arising from the nasal region. The patient received multiple systemic treatment lines between 2006 and 2014, but all of them were without long-lasting effect. In August 2014, he was referred to our radiotherapy unit and received a conventional radiotherapy with 12 MeV electrons and 6 MV and 18 MV photons. The patient received 36 Gy in 18 fractions (2 Gy per fraction, 5 fractions per week). The lesions disappeared within a few weeks, and no clinical relapse had been noted 3 years after the treatment.

Clinical Findings:
The extent, progression, and resistance of skin lesions gave a palliative intent to the patient's treatment project. The patient reported that the appearance of his nose refrained him from interacting with people, which led him progressively to get socially isolated. He reported difficulties in interacting with his family members, especially with his young grandchildren. The patient presented acute grade I radiodermatitis, which resolved spontaneously.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient presented with Folliculotropic Mycosis Fungoides and was treated with a course of conventional radiotherapy. The lesions disappeared within a few weeks, and no clinical relapse has been noted after 3 years of follow-up. The patient reported a psychological relief due to the recovery of the normal appearance of his nose and was able to resume some of his social activities, use public transportation, and better interact with friends and family members.

Follow-Up:
The patient is recommended to follow up with his primary care physician for routine check-ups. He is also advised to monitor any changes in his skin lesions and report them immediately if there are any concerns. The patient should also continue to practice good skin hygiene and sun protection measures and avoid exposure to any irritants or allergens.

History and Presenting Problem: 
This 5-year-old boy with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) presented with intellectual disability (ID), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), joint hyperlaxity, and morphogenetic anomalies. The patient’s mother had a history of epilepsy with tonic–clonic seizures, photosensitivity, and moderate elevation in serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels following physical exercise.

Assessment and Findings: 
The patient was born from non-consanguineous parents after an uneventful dizygotic twin pregnancy. He had delayed milestones and showed a lack of eye contact, visual tracking, and social interest from early on. EEG showed focal spikes over the frontal region and the left temporal region and generalized spike-and-wave complexes during sleep. A brain MRI showed normal results. Muscular dystrophy was confirmed through genetic analysis of the dystrophin gene which detected the deletion of exons 46-51 of the gene. The child presented with severe developmental delays and autistic features, including poor eye contact, absence of protodeclarative pointing, attention deficit, and inadequate social-communicative abilities. Joint hyperlaxity and peculiar facial traits were noted, including a high forehead, epicanthic folds, deep-set eyes, an elongated face, and large ears. Following array-CGH analysis and FMR1 molecular analysis, the comorbidity with Fragile X syndrome (FXS) was confirmed.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with chronic active Epstein-Barr virus infection of T/NK-cell type, systemic form.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted due to a seizure and a history of wasting and worsening health condition for six months. Upon admission, he presented with recurrent fever, hepatosplenomegaly, and acute kidney failure. The patient underwent several diagnostic approaches, including CT scan, PET-CT, bone marrow biopsy, and thyroid gland biopsy. These examinations revealed atypical pulmonary infiltrates, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, increased LDH, mild pancytopenia, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Bronchial lavage was positive for Aspergillus antigen, but the patient's symptoms were not fully explained by pulmonary aspergillosis. The high positive proteinase 3 titer (1:135) indicated granulomatosis with polyangiitis, but biopsy of the kidney was not performed due to low platelet counts.

The patient was treated with high-dose steroid burst initially. However, the patient's condition worsened rapidly with further loss of weight and intermittent high fever despite antibiotic and antifungal treatments, and the assumption of granulomatosis with polyangiitis was ruled out. Infectious disease testing, including human immunodeficiency virus, Tuberculosis, Schistosomiasis, Malaria, and Leishmaniosis were negative, except for previous Hepatitis B and EBV infection. EBV DNA in the peripheral blood reached high levels. The clinical criteria for HLH were evaluated, but they were not fulfilled, and no typical findings of HLH were seen in the bone marrow biopsy. 

Treatment:
Based on the data by Sawada et al., the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and cyclophosphamide as a cooling down step to reduce the high viral load. The patient developed an epileptic seizure and clinical symptoms of meningitis, and a lumbar puncture was performed. Cranial MRI showed typical radiological signs for viral meningitis. The patient was initiated chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) due to the clinical progression. Despite its limited activity for EBV-infection, treatment with foscavir was started. Upon two cycles of CHOP, the EBV load decreased remarkably from 2.8 × 106 copies/mL to < 200 copies/mL. An additional cycle of CHOP was administered and the patient remained in complete remission so far.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with their physician regularly. Further diagnostic imaging, laboratory work, or close clinical follow-up may be required to monitor the patient's condition.

Discharge Instructions:
1. Follow up with your physician regularly.
2. Take medications as prescribed.

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient was admitted to the hematology department of the Henri Becquerel Center in Rouen in May 1999 for diplopia with clinical signs of intracranial hypertension. A cerebral CT scan showed left frontal, left parietal, right occipital, and right lateral lesions strongly enhanced after injection of contrast medium with perilesional edema and mass effect on the lateral ventricles. An encephalic MRI was performed which confirmed the visible lesions on the initial CT scan. A stereotaxic biopsy was performed and histological samples indicated a large B-cell lymphoma with a centroblastic phenotype. The initial assessment therefore concludes with the diagnosis of multiple-site PNCSL of the brain.

The patient presented with a Karnofksy Performance status (KPS) of 70% (ECOG PS = 2), LDH were not elevated, cell blood count, and standard chemical test revealed no abnormalities, CSF protein was mildly increased (0.47 g/L) with negative cytology, and there were no deep brain lesions. CSF flow cytometry was not performed. The patient’s IELSG prognostic index was considered “intermediate” and the patient was treated with debulking chemotherapy followed by 2 cycles of induction followed by 2 cycles of consolidation and whole-brain radiotherapy with 40 Grays in 16 fractions enabling a first complete remission (CR) lasting 2 years.

First relapse occurred in February 2001, and the patient was treated with chemotherapy and salvage chemotherapy. The patient recovered from the second relapse with intensive chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant.

The patient achieved third CR which is clinically persisting 9 years after the end of treatment. Medical follow-up was marked by ear, nose, throat infectious complications, with immunological deficiency due to compensated hypogammaglobulinemia, and renal failure related to chronic tubulointerstitial nephropathy post-antibiotherapy, relatively stable since 2010.",,,0

Hospital Course Summary:

Admission:
The patient was admitted to the Department of Operative Dentistry at Dow Dental College with complaints of pain in a previously treated left maxillary lateral incisor. The patient experienced pain on percussion, but showed no discharging sinus and had normal mobility. She exhibited an unusual cervical depression mesially and a 5 mm isolated probing defect on the palatal aspect with an associated shallow palatogingival groove. Cold test revealed the lateral incisor was non-vital, while the adjacent central incisor and canine were vital. Radiographically, a poorly obturated canal was present with a periapical radiolucency and an untreated accessory root with a patent canal. A diagnosis of previous inadequate treatment and chronic apical periodontitis secondary to an untreated canal was made, and non-surgical endodontic retreatment was planned.

Hospitalization:
The patient underwent non-surgical endodontic retreatment using calcium hydroxide and ProTaper rotary NiTi instruments. Subsequently, both canals were dried, and sodium hypochlorite was used to remove dressing. Canals were obturated with warm vertical technique using an obturation device and resin-based sealer. The access cavity was restored with a flowable composite resin.

Discharge:
The patient returned after a month for a recall visit and complained of recurring pain and pus discharge. It was decided to perform surgical retreatment, and a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised. A defect in buccal plate was visible around the apex of the accessory root, and the periapical lesion was easily removed due to no attachment to either root. The bony window was filled with an irradiated allograft and covered with a resorbable collagen membrane. Sling suturing technique with 3.0 silk sutures was used for primary closure. The stitches were removed after a week. On a 2-year follow-up, the patient reported complete absence of symptoms and reduced periodontal probing depth on palatal aspect. Radiographic signs of complete healing but with mild discoloration of the clinical crown were observed, which were treated with a walking bleach technique using sodium perborate powder.

Summary:
The patient was admitted with complaints of pain from a previously treated left maxillary lateral incisor and a diagnosis of previous inadequate treatment and chronic apical periodontitis secondary to an untreated canal was made. Non-surgical endodontic retreatment was performed, followed by surgical retreatment due to recurring pain and pus discharge. The patient was treated with a full thickness mucoperiosteal flap and no root end resection was performed, due to easy removal of periapical lesion.

Hospital Course:

The 30-day-old Caucasian baby girl was referred to our hospital due to the detection of an intraabdominal cystic mass during the last trimester of pregnancy. Following a physical examination and imaging studies, the patient was diagnosed with an intraabdominal cystic mass, with no presence of malignancy. During surgery, it was found that the patient had torsion in her left adnexa, and a necrotic ovary was discovered. A left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed along with an incidental appendectomy. An oophoropexy was carried out on her right ovary, with absorbable suture at the level of the pelvic brim of the sidewall of her abdomen after draining peripheral cysts. A pathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of a necrotic ovary, with cysts smaller than 1 cm on her contralateral ovary, which were aspirated during surgery. The postoperative period showed no signs of wound infections or peritonitis, and the patient was discharged on the third postoperative day.

Follow-up:

The patient had regular check-ups with pelvic and Doppler imaging of her ovary after surgery. At 6 months of follow-up, the cysts, which were smaller than 1 cm, redeveloped up to 2 cm and then spontaneously disappeared.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a suspected tumor in her pelvis. An MRI examination revealed mobility of the tumor, which led to further investigations. A mass-sized 45 mm on the right side of the pelvic floor was found through a contrast CT image. The tumor was nourished by vessels from the splenic artery to the greater omentum. Based on the diagnostic tests and imaging findings, a preoperative diagnosis of a suspected omental primary tumor or accessory spleen was made. The patient underwent a single-incision laparoscopic-assisted greater omental tumor resection, a surgery to remove the tumor, to prevent torsion and to diagnose and treat the tumor concurrently. The greater omentum and the tumor were removed without any complications.

Diagnosis:
The histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of an omental PEComa, a tumor involving large and small blood vessels. These tumors are rare and originate from perivascular epithelioid cells.

History:

The patient, a 14-year-old male, presented to the Department of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry with the chief complaint of a broken tooth in the upper front region which had been present for two years. The patient reported a history of root canal treatment on the same tooth two years prior. The patient was diagnosed with ADHD with primarily hyperactive subtype at 6 years of age and was taking Sizodon (Risperidone). The family history was insignificant except for the fact that the patient's mother experienced a high caries rate. The patient had a habit of keeping food in the mouth for a prolonged period (food pouching) and exhibited self-inflicted injuries such as hitting on the wall and banging head.

Physical Examination:

On physical examination, endomorphic features and scar marks on the face and upper limbs were observed. Intraoral examination showed crown fracture up to the gingival third with 21, dental caries with 16, 15, 26, 36, 46, retained 53, deep dentinal caries with 14, 24, 25, 31, and 32, unilateral crossbite on the right side, and rotated 11. Pulp vitality tests showed negative results with 24, 31, 32.

Treatment:

The patient underwent oral prophylaxis, restoration with respect to 16, 15, 26, 36, 46, root canal therapy with respect to 24, 31, 32, core build-up with a crown with respect to 14, 25, post and core with a crown with respect to 21 (after gingivectomy), and extraction of 53. Orthodontic treatment was not pursued due to the patient's habit of self-inflicting injuries.

Follow-up:

The patient was reasonably cooperative during the treatment, but occasional skipping of doses of medication led to increased fidgetiness and slight aggression. Appropriate nonpharmacological behavior management, such as Tell-Show-Do, positive reinforcement, and breaks/time-outs, was employed, and treatment was rendered successfully. The patient returned for a follow-up after 6 months, and intraoral examination showed no caries and proper oral hygiene maintenance.

Medical Diagnosis:
• Vulvar sarcoma

History of Presenting Illness and Treatment:
The patient was treated with proton beam radiotherapy and developed a painful ulcer within the irradiation field a month after completing treatment. She received sustained-release oxycodone starting at 40 mg/day, which was gradually increased up to 160 mg/day (MED 240 mg/day) for pain control. The ulcer was relieved through skin grafting. The oxycodone dosage was gradually reduced, with mild restlessness occurring at 20 mg/day (12.5% of the maximum dosage); however, administration of the same dosage was continued as the symptom was mild and disappeared after a few days.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient reported experiencing cold sweats, malaise, and leg pain six hours after discontinuing oxycodone. Administration of sustained-release oxycodone (10 mg/day) once again was recommended, leading to the disappearance of symptoms. The patient continued receiving this medication for approximately five months due to fear of experiencing withdrawal symptoms. Final oxycodone discontinuation was achieved 323 days after the first onset of withdrawal symptoms.

Summary:
The patient was admitted due to treatment for vulvar sarcoma that was complicated by a painful ulcer. Pain control was achieved through sustained-release oxycodone, which saw a gradual decrease in dosage amount over the course of several months. Mild restlessness occurred at a dosage reduction of 20 mg/day, but the same dosage was administered continuously, and the symptom soon vanished. After experiencing withdrawal symptoms upon oxycodone discontinuation, sustained-release oxycodone administration was re-started and gradually reduced until discontinuation was achieved 323 days after the first onset of withdrawal symptoms.",,,0

2139,"Hospital Course Summary:

This 55-year-old Chinese male was admitted with a week-long history of fever, upper abdominal pain, and yellowing of his eyes. On admission, he was found to be lethargic with jaundice and tenderness in the right hypochondrium. Diagnostic imaging revealed a diffusely thickened and oedematous gallbladder, thrombosis in the right portal vein, and in the splenic vein with splenic infarcts seen. A diagnosis of severe sepsis from acute acalculous cholecystitis was made, and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy was carried out. Intraoperatively, the gallbladder was found to be distended, inflamed, and containing turbid bile. Postoperatively, the patient developed septic shock and multiorgan failure requiring mechanical ventilation and inotropic support in the ICU. Burkholderia pseudomallei, a bacterial infection, was identified in peripheral blood and intraoperative bile fluid cultures. The patient had undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and suffered additional complications of dry gangrene of his hands and feet from the severe sepsis and high inotropic requirements. The patient was continued on intravenous meropenem for a month before converting to enteral trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole for another three months.

Date of Discharge: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the Endocrinological section of the Pediatric Unit due to short stature. The patient exhibited unusual facial features that included hypertelorism, low-set ears, a low posterior hairline, down-slanting palpebral fissures, pectus excavatum, and ogival palate. The patient's family history included paternal familiarity for psychotic crises in his adolescence and mother with thrombophilia and history of five pregnancies with three spontaneous abortions and two parts.

The following diagnostic tests were conducted: full blood count, inflammatory markers, renal function, hepatic function, coeliac screening, and thyroid function tests, which produced normal results. The bone age was delayed by 2 years. Radiological and laboratory tests to rule out related renal, cardiac, ophthalmologic, and audiological abnormalities did not find any significant alterations. The patient exhibited a mild cognitive impairment compared with the standard for his age that included a prevalent verbal difficulty.

The peak growth hormone (GH) value in a clonidine stimulation test was within a normal range, while the IGF-1 level was within normal limits. Due to the presence of a mesomelic short stature, two genetic mutations were considered and a genetic evaluation of the PTPN11 gene and the SHOX gene were requested.

The genetic tests confirmed Noonan Syndrome (NS) because a c.922A>G (rs28933386) heterozygous mutation in exon 8 of the PTPN11 gene leading to a p.Asn308Asp substitution was identified. In addition, a microduplication involving the SHOX gene was identified. GH treatment (0.2 mg/kg/wk) was prescribed, and after 18 months, there was improvement in the patient's height, weight, and growth velocity.

At discharge, the patient's height was 109.8 cm, weight was 18 kg, growth velocity was 7 cm/year, arm span:height ratio was 96%, and sitting height:height ratio was 56%. Follow-up appointments have been scheduled every 6 months.

Patient: 52-year-old female

Admission Date: September, 2016

Admitting diagnosis: Colon cancer

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted due to space-occupying lesions in the colon found during medical examination. Histopathological examination of endoscopic biopsy specimens confirmed moderately differentiated colonic adenocarcinoma. Contrast-enhanced computer tomography (CT) of the abdomen detected several small lymph nodes scattered around the intestine. Laparoscopic examination confirmed the tumor was located in the hepatic flexure of the colon. The clinicopathologic stage was pT3N0M0. Laparoscopy-assisted colectomy was performed to resect the right colonic mass and its surrounding tissue followed by ileocolonic anastomosis.

Family History:

The patient's mother, sister, and brother were diagnosed with colon cancer.

Diagnosis:

Based on Amsterdam II criteria, the patient was diagnosed with Lynch syndrome (LS). A pathogenic variant in MLH1 (c.1852_1854delAAG, p.K618del) was identified in the patient's blood samples. All the siblings and offspring carrying the MLH1 mutation in this family will be monitored on a long-term basis.

Treatment:

No adjuvant chemotherapy was given after surgery.

Discharge Plan:

All individuals carrying the MLH1 mutation in this family will receive long-term follow-up care. The patient will be advised to undergo regular colonoscopy and urine test once a year, and gastroscopy every 3~ 5 years after 35 years old. An asymptomatic carrier of the MLH1 mutation showed signs of dysplasia during endoscopy. The individual received oral administration of aspirin as a preventative treatment, and was advised to undergo regular colonoscopy examination.",,,0
426,"Hospital Course:
The 51-year-old male patient was admitted with hypercalcemia, renal failure, and persistent leg and low back pain. On admission, he reported fatigue, bone pain, and polyuria. Physical examination revealed no specific findings of the lymph nodes, head, neck, heart, lung, abdomen, or joints. Laboratory testing revealed corrected serum calcium of 3.39 mmol/L, phosphorus of 0.84 mmol/L, PTH of 540 ng/mL, serum creatinine of 151 μmol/L (after hemodialysis), and hemoglobin of 120 g/L. Urine calcium was 9.2 mmol/24 h. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed complete right bundle branch block and a precordial abnormal ST segment and normal corrected QT (QTc) interval. Ultrasonography revealed a nodule at the left lower pole of the parathyroid gland. Single-photon emission computed tomography results indicated an adenoma of the left lower pole of the parathyroid gland.

Treatment:
Hydration with 3000 mL of fluid per day, furosemide at 40 mg three times per day, cinacalcet at 25 mg per day, and RRT were utilized to reduce serum calcium levels. Slow extended dialysis with low-calcium dialysate (1.25 mmol) at bedside was started using a commercially available continuous RRT device (multiFiltrate, Fresenius Medical Care Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany). Due to no family history of such disease and no medication history of thiazide or lithium, a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism caused by a parathyroid adenoma was made. However, due to the high level of troponin T and changes to the ST segment on an ECG, parathyroidectomy was deferred for multidisciplinary consultation.

Outcome: 
After gradual reduction of serum calcium levels and preparation for parathyroidectomy, the patient underwent parathyroidectomy and an untypical parathyroid adenoma was pathologically confirmed. Postoperatively, PTH dropped to 16.9 ng/L and serum calcium dropped to 2.25 mmol/L. Serum calcium was 2.11 mmol/L and serum creatinine was 173 μmol/L at discharge.

Diagnosis and Treatment:
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of ipilimumab-related acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) after receiving two doses of ipilimumab 10 mg/kg IV for stage IIIB superficial spreading melanoma. The patient developed parasthesias in the distal lower extremities bilaterally that subsequently ascended to involve proximal lower extremities, then upper extremities along with weakness and loss of deep tendon reflexes. MRI brain and whole spine revealed abnormal enhancement involving the bilateral 5th, 7th and 8th cranial nerves, cauda equina nerve roots as well as the conus surface and peripheral nerves at the thoracolumbar junction. CSF studies were negative for malignant cells but showed lymphocytic pleocytosis and elevated CSF protein. Methylprednisolone 1.5 mg/kg twice daily was initiated with rapid improvement in motor symptoms in hands and lower extremities after 2 days. Steroids were gradually tapered over a 12-week period with gradual recovery. The patient was also treated for concomitant adrenal insufficiency with physiologic doses of hydrocortisone. 

Outcome:
The patient's weakness resolved completely, with the exception of minimal parasthesias in upper extremities and lower extremities in a glove-and-stocking distribution. Approximately 4 months after initial ipilimumab therapy, the patient developed hypothyroidism for which he was treated with levothyroxine 125mcg daily. Systemic imaging studies remain negative for recurrent disease.

History of Presenting Illness

The patient was admitted to our hospital due to dysphagia. Endoscopic examination revealed a circumferential tumor with ulceration in the cervical esophagus, and biopsies confirmed squamous cell carcinoma. Contrast-enhanced CT showed extensive tumor growth in the esophagus with suspected tracheal invasion and enlarged lymph nodes extending from the cervical region to the upper mediastinum. FDG-PET/CT revealed abnormal FDG accumulation in the primary lesion and lymph nodes from the cervical to upper mediastinal region. However, due to the patient's past medical history of sarcoidosis, it was challenging to determine whether the multiple lymphadenopathy was benign or metastatic.

Hospital Course

The patient received definitive chemoradiotherapy to preserve the larynx. After 2 months of treatment, the patient had complete disappearance of FDG uptake in the primary cancer in the esophagus. However, there was only a slight reduction in FDG uptake in the mediastinal lymph nodes, which was likely affected by sarcoidosis. The primary lesion of the esophagus relapsed 3 months later, and the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy with gastric tube reconstruction via the posterior mediastinal route. The pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus. The resected lymph nodes demonstrated no tumor metastasis, but some lymph nodes showed granulomatous reactions and contained several small epithelioid cell granulomas, suggesting the presence of sarcoidosis. The final stage was determined as pT2N0M0, pStage IB (UICC 7th).

Hospital Course Summary

During the hospital course, the patient received definitive chemoradiotherapy to preserve the larynx. However, the primary lesion in the cervical esophagus relapsed 3 months later, and the patient underwent thoracoscopic and laparoscopic total laryngopharyngoesophagectomy. The final pathological diagnosis was moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the cervical esophagus with no lymph node metastasis. The patient was discharged 27 days after surgery, and a follow-up CT performed 6 months after surgery showed no tumor recurrence.

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 63-year-old male with a history of left-sided weakness due to a previous cerebrovascular accident, epilepsy, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and a recent diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, was admitted with fever, nausea, vomiting, and tachycardia. Initial tests showed systemic inflammation and consolidation in the left lower lobe of the lung. Further investigations revealeda distended gallbladder with a suspected abscess or hemorrhage. Empiric antibiotics therapy was started for suspected sepsis. The patient was ruled out for surgery initially due to elevated INR levels but was considered a high-risk patient for surgery. An IR-guided cholecystostomy was attempted but was unsuccessful, and the patient's INR continued to rise with a subsequent drop in hemoglobin levels. The patient eventually underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which was converted to an open cholecystectomy due to significant bleeding. During the surgery, the gallbladder was found to have necrosis and perforation with a large amount of old clot and dense adhesions to the liver. Pathology confirmed acute inflammation and necrosis. The patient required additional blood transfusions due to postoperative bleeding from the Jackson-Pratt drain. The patient remained stable for the remainder of the hospitalization and was discharged with an inferior vena cava filter in place due to the high risk of further anticoagulation.

The electrocardiogram showed diffuse repolarisation changes, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed impaired systolic function of the left ventricle.

Diagnostic imaging including CT of the chest with contrast matter and coronary angiography showed no evidence of acute myocardial infarction or aortic dissection. However, a peculiar finding was noted in the right lung, identified as an azygos vein passing through the upper lobe and separating an azygos lobe with its mesoazygos.

Further laboratory tests showed significantly elevated cardiac enzymes including creatine phosphokinase (CPK), creatine phosphokinase myocardial band fraction (CPK-MB), and troponin T. Blood lipid tests were within reference ranges.

Microbiological testing yielded a diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which was concluded to be the cause of acute myocarditis.

Treatment was initiated for the EBV infection, following which the patient recovered. The patient was discharged in stable condition and advised to follow up with the primary care physician.

Final Diagnosis: Type A aortic dissection (DeBakey type I) with Gluteal Compartment Syndrome (GCS) following Bentall procedure with hemiarch replacement.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted with severe chest pain and diagnosed with a type A aortic dissection (DeBakey type I). Despite an uneventful postoperative course after a Bentall procedure with hemiarch replacement, the patient experienced Gluteal Compartment Syndrome (GCS), resulting in severe pain to his left buttock. A CT angiography scan of the pelvis subsequently showed a dissection flap ending proximal to the iliac bifurcation without direct involvement of the iliac arteries and preoperative CT angiography showed left gluteus muscle swelling. The patient was diagnosed with GCS, further supported by a peak creatine kinase of 91,865 U/L.

The patient underwent a Kocher-Langenbeck procedure and was discharged home on postoperative day 13. However, after 17 weeks, the patient returned to work and noticed intermittent claudication. Peripheral vascular impedance plethysmography and contrast-enhanced CT confirmed a 50% stenosis of the left iliac arterial axis. The patient was treated conservatively and is doing well without residual claudication 2 years thereafter.

History and Findings:
The patient is a 66-year-old Caucasian man who was admitted with an enlarged prostate and urinary retention. Pelvic ultrasonography confirmed a prostate volume of 158 cc. The patient underwent Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP). During the procedure, a damaged lens in the nephroscope resulted in an extremely poor cystoscopic image. A 3.5-MHz convex abdominal transducer was used under B-mode ultrasound to view the bladder and guide morcellation. The enucleated adenoma was seen in the dependent portion of the distended bladder with both the nephroscope and Piranha morcellator just entering the bladder neck. Transurethral morcellation was initiated with the Wolf Piranha Scope and the Piranha morcellator at the manufacturer's recommended settings.

Treatment and Outcome:
With guidance from the ultrasound probe, the operator successfully aimed the morcellator tip in the direction of the enucleated adenoma and safely removed it from the walls of the bladder. A final inspection with both ultrasound and a functional cystoscope lens confirmed no remaining adenoma pieces within the prostatic fossa and bladder. The patient was discharged from the hospital the next day and experienced an uneventful postoperative recovery.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to our hospital with a one-year history of right ankle pain following trauma due to a car accident. The patient had previously undergone open reduction and internal fixation in his right ankle for a fracture at another hospital. His ankle pain persisted despite the intra-articular injections, arthroscopic synovectomy, and fixation implant removal performed at our hospital. The patient was diagnosed with progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond. A surgical repair of the osteochondral defect was recommended, and three months later, the patient underwent an osteochondral graft procedure on his right ankle. The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and a range of motion exercises were initiated immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks. The patient was able to return to standing work 10 months after surgery. The most recent magnetic resonance imaging scans at 2 years after surgery showed that the cartilage in the anterolateral joint surface was almost intact, and there was no osteonecrosis. The patient remained asymptomatic with respect to the donor sites of the right knee. On the latest physical examination, the patient complained of mild pain in his right ankle while walking, but could walk for 30 min. The postoperative AOFAS ankle score was 80. The patient was able to return to carpenter's work on a five-day week, but remained with minor ankle pain on standing up and walking for more than half an hour over the 3-year observation period.

Findings:
The radiographs showed moderate narrowing of the ankle joint and forward displacement of the talus, and the computed tomography of the right ankle showed an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond. The osteochondral defect was diagnosed as grade 2 according to the classification of the International Cartilage Repair Society.

Diagnosis:
Progressive osteoarthritis caused by an osteochondral defect on the anterolateral surface of the distal tibial plafond.

Treatment:
Surgical repair of the osteochondral defect performed via an osteochondral graft procedure. The patient underwent range of motion exercises immediately after cast removal at 4 weeks, with partial progressive weightbearing allowed during the next 4 weeks.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Age: 66
Gender: Female

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the gastroenterology ward for muco-bloody stools and diffuse pain in the abdomen due to alternate constipation and diarrhea. She had a history of undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) for 20 years and aplastic anemia (AA) for 1 year. Physical examination showed extensive abdominal tenderness. The patient had cytopenia due to AA and no obvious abnormality in stool culture for pathogens. Blood cultures were also negative. A computer tomography (CT) scan showed no portal venous gas embolism. Colonoscopy revealed line or pebble-like sessile cysts and irregular forms, mainly in sigmoid. The colonoscopy was incomplete due to the narrowing of the lumen secondary to these lesions. Pathologic findings revealed submucosal cystic structure. 

Treatment:
The gas cysts were treated with high frequency electrosurgical resection. The patient was advised to eat less gas-producing foods and was treated with aluminum phosphate and bifidobacterium, but no antibiotics were prescribed due to her history of AA.

Outcome:
The patient's symptoms of diarrhea improved significantly after one month, and gas-filled cysts became flattened. After ten months of follow-up, the clinical symptoms were still resolved.

The patient is advised to continue with a low-gas diet and a follow-up appointment with the gastroenterologist in three months is recommended.",,,0
2016,"Hospital Course:

The patient is an 83-year-old male who had surgical excision of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) at the right knee at an outside facility. He was then referred to our hospital for further chemotherapy. On initial presentation to our hospital, he was complaining of severe pelvic and low back pain.

Diagnostic Tests:

A PET CT was performed which showed multiple bony lesions with a variable degree of metabolic activity, suggesting metastases. Follow-up imaging revealed the lesions to have an unusual doughnut-like appearance with a central lytic area surrounded by a well-defined sclerotic margin and a second concentric band (halo) with a ground-glass appearance surrounded by a thin sclerotic rim.

Diagnosis:

Bone biopsy of a lesion with the doughnut appearance located in the left pubic bone confirmed infiltration of bone marrow by malignant spindle-shaped cells arranged neatly in bundles, which were consistent with metastases from the MPNST.

Hospital Course:

The patient was subsequently treated with chemotherapy and monitored for any complications. He was discharged in a stable condition with plans for close outpatient follow-up and additional imaging studies to track the progression of the disease. Careful attention will be given to manage his pain and provide him with supportive care as needed. Arrangements were made for a timely follow-up with his oncologist.",,,0

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our hospital for investigation of urinary incontinence. She presented with continuous low volume urine leakage that required 4-5 daily pads. The patient had normal voiding habits and no urge to void. On initial physical examination, the external genitalia showed no vaginal pooling of urine, normal urethral and vaginal openings, but intermittent urine leakage through the vaginal orifice. In her medical history, she had recurrent febrile UTIs since infancy, and was diagnosed with vesicoureteral reflux grade III on the right kidney. Despite chronic chemoprophylaxis, she continued to experience urinary incontinence. An abdominal ultrasound was performed which revealed normal kidneys with duplex-system suspicion on the left side and a normal-looking bladder. The VCUG was repeated, but no VUR was detected. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed, which revealed a duplicated collecting system on the left side, and both ureters extended from the kidney to the point of extravesical insertion into the vagina. Both ectopic ureters were in very close vicinity. A diagnosis of ectopic ureter was made, and the patient was discharged with appropriate follow-up care.

Admitting Diagnosis: Broken front tooth with pus discharge

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient, a 12-year-old boy, presented with a broken right lateral incisor and pus discharge. He gave a history of fall while playing one year back, which resulted in an Ellis class III fracture. The tooth was tender to percussion and showed grade I mobility. Radiographic examination revealed a displaced fractured root apex with periapical radiolucency. Upon exploring the canal, a wooden stick was found firmly stuck at the apex which the patient had inserted himself since the fracture to counteract irritation.

Attempts were made to remove the wooden stick using ultrasonic, H-Files, and ProTaper files, none of which were successful. It was ultimately decided that surgical intervention was necessary. A labial mucoperiosteal flap was raised, and bone cutting was performed using a surgical bur. The displaced fractured immature root apex and the wooden stick were removed. The root was retrograde filled using zirconium-reinforced glass ionomer cement.

The patient was kept comfortable throughout their stay, and vital signs remained stable. There were no complications during the procedure or postoperatively. The patient was discharged and given instructions to follow up with their dentist for further evaluation and management.

Hospital Course:

The 14-year-old male adolescent was admitted to the emergency department due to subfebrile temperatures and localized pain in his right popliteal fossa. Prior to these symptoms, the patient had been immobilized following a minor sports injury. The patient's medical history revealed an asymptomatic antithrombin deficiency (ATD) diagnosed 8 years ago and a maternal history of ATD. No other hereditary thrombophilic disorders were detected. The patient's blood analysis indicated elevated levels of D-dimers and C-reactive protein (CrP), and reduced antithrombin activity. The vascular ultrasound confirmed thrombosis of the right lower extremity. The patient received continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin followed by direct thrombin inhibition by argatroban. Empirical antibiotic treatment was initiated.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results showed complete deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, and extended thromboses of the left lower extremity and thrombosis of both iliac vessels. It also revealed occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with prominent venous lumbar collaterals suggestive of IVC associated with ATD. Catheter-directed local thrombolysis using recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was initiated in both extremities. Anticoagulative therapy was switched from argatroban to vitamin K antagonist phenprocoumon. The patient was discharged on day eight after hospital admission.

A follow-up examination showed extended re-thrombosis of both pelvic axes and the right lower extremity, leading to a second hospital admission and re-induction of therapy. Recanalization of the right lower extremity and pelvic axis was subsequently achieved, but the left pelvic vessels remained thrombotic. The patient's oral anticoagulation was intensified to prevent re-thrombosis. Regular follow-up examinations at the outpatient clinic did not give evidence for any new thrombotic events to date.

The patient was discharged on day seven after admission. The left iliac vessels remain thrombotic, but the IVC was successfully recanalized using balloon dilation and subsequent stenting. The patient’s mother was also found to have recanalized IVC upon angiography intervention.

Discharge Diagnosis:

1. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the right lower extremity, left lower extremity, both iliac vessels, and inferior vena cava (IVC) associated with antithrombin deficiency (ATD).

2. Recanalized IVC and thrombotic left iliac vessels.

3. IVCA.

Recommendations:

1. Oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon should be continued lifelong to prevent thrombosis due to the combination of extended multilocal thromboses with underlying ATD.

2. Follow-up examinations should be done regularly at the outpatient clinic.

3. The patient and their family should be counseled on the importance of continued medical management for ATD.

4. More interventions should be done for thrombotic lesions found in pelvic vessels.

Chief Complaint: Rectal pain, pruritus ani, blood in semen, rectal bleeding, and fecal incontinence
Summary: The patient presented to the emergency department with severe, novel, left-sided rectal pain that was diagnosed as perirectal abscess. Following incision and drainage, the patient experienced worsening of rectal pain which was assumed to be due to an anal fissure. The patient was lost-to-follow-up but later presented to a bariatric surgeon with new onset of pruritus ani and no evidence of anorectal pain, hemorrhoids, fissures or fistulas. Upon repeated examinations, the patient continued to have rectal pain, rectal bleeding, pruritus ani, blood in semen, and fecal incontinence. The patient underwent DxHA injections with positive outcomes. A 15 mm benign-appearing submucosal lesion was identified in the distal rectum, which was biopsy-tested. Further investigation revealed that the rectal lesion and its corresponding pathology was a result of the patient's FI treatment with DxHA injections. Though the patient showed early improvement with DxHA injections, long-term outcomes exhibit worsening of FI (several episodes daily, especially after bowel movements).

Hospital Course:

- Emergency department visit with the diagnosis of perirectal abscess

- Incision and drainage of the abscess

- Worsening of rectal pain presumed to be due to an anal fissure

- Lost-to-follow-up

Hospital Course:
[Patient's Name], an 83-year-old Japanese woman, was admitted to our department with a chief complaint of a mass in her right maxillary premolar region. The patient had initially noticed a painless mass in her right maxillary premolar region in 2002, but she did not seek any treatment for it. She was referred to us for examination and treatment due to difficulty in performing tracheal intubation for surgery of sigmoid colon cancer at another hospital.

After performing several tests, the patient was diagnosed with peripheral ossifying fibroma with squamous cell carcinoma. We suspected a benign gingival tumor in the right maxillary premolar region, which was confirmed by a biopsy. Later, tumorectomy was performed under general anesthesia to remove the tumor, including the surrounding tissue. One week after surgery, the wound was covered with an oral appliance for protection.

The microscopic findings of the surgically removed tumor were similar to those of the biopsy specimen. The tumor was composed of spindle-shaped cells that were proliferating with collagenous fiber, and scattered bone formation was also observed. The epithelial component of the tumor was considered to be well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. No signs of local recurrence or metastasis have been observed during follow-up.

Patient History:
The patient's history included sigmoid colon cancer, subarachnoid hemorrhaging, bronchitic asthma, and cardiac insufficiency.

Physical Exam:
Regarding the intra- and extra-oral findings, a massive pedunculated mass in the right maxillary premolar region measuring 83 × 58 × 35 mm was palpable. Furthermore, it covered the front of the right palate, and it protruded to the extra-oral region from the right maxillary premolar alveolar region. Its surface was almost entirely smooth, and some erosions and ulcerations were seen. It was elastic and hard and showed no tenderness on palpation. There was no palpable regional lymphadenopathy.

Diagnosis:
Peripheral ossifying fibroma with squamous cell carcinoma (pT1N0M0)

Treatment:
Tumorectomy was performed under general anesthesia to remove the tumor, including the surrounding tissue. One week after surgery, the wound was covered with an oral appliance for protection.

Condition at discharge:
At the time of discharge, the patient's condition was stable, and there were no signs of local recurrence or metastasis during follow-up.

Follow-Up Plan:
The patient will continue regular follow-up appointments with her primary care physician to monitor for any signs of recurrence or metastasis.",,,0

Patient: 73-year-old man

Clinical Diagnosis: Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)

History of Presenting Illness: The patient was complaining of an urge to move his legs that was accompanied by unpleasant sensations that worsened during rest and before sleep. He was experiencing difficulty in falling asleep and nonrestorative sleep, and had an IRLS score of 11. The patient reported feeling uncomfortable even after prolonged sleep, and claimed no relief from fatigue. Physical examination and laboratory test results indicated normal findings.

Hospital Course: A full-night diagnostic PSG recording was obtained when the patient was on hypnotic medication (zolpidem, 5 mg). It was revealed that the patient was experiencing difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep due to discomfort associated with periodic leg movement bursts. The patient received 4W-acuinjections of normal saline doses (0.25 mL each) supplemented with pentazocine (0.5 mg per dose) in both legs after the first 115 min of PSG. Light PLM bursts reappeared 124 minutes later, but the patient reported remarkably restorative sleep in the morning. Most of the PLMs were observed during stage wakefulness periods, where slow eye movements were observed while EEG was alpha-rhythm dominant, thus, discomfort accompanied by PLMs during drowsy periods, rather than wakefulness, seemed to disrupt his attempts to fall asleep. After 4W-acuinjections, the patient's PLM index (number of PLMs/total recording h) decreased and his percent sleep efficiency increased.

Discharge Diagnosis: The patient was diagnosed with RLS.

Discharge Medications: None prescribed.

Follow-up Care: The patient is advised to follow-up with his primary care physician for further evaluation and management of his RLS.",,,0

A 71-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with right hip dysfunction without a history of injury. The patient experienced local pain over 4 months and gradually lost the ability to stand and walk because of the pain in the hip while reporting no pain while sleeping. Physical examination revealed tenderness and restricted range of motion in the right hip. The length of the right leg was 4 cm shorter than the left leg. We performed computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging, and emission computed tomography. The radiologic tests showed a deficiency in the right femoral head and neck.

After countering out other causes for the deficiency, we discovered that the patient had syphilitic arthritis. Percutaneous needle biopsy of synovium in the right hip I indicates that periangitis, obliterative endarteritis, and an intense infiltration of plasma cells accompanied by scattered macrophages and lymphocytes were in the lesion. These correspond to the characteristics of syphilitic lesions. The diagnosis of syphilitic arthritis caused by early syphilis, rather than cancer metastasis or TB, results in the deficiency of the right femoral head and neck.

We performed total hip arthroplasty (THA) on the patient, followed by radical joint debridement and bone graft to rebuild the extensive acetabular lateral wall defect. We performed intraoperative and postoperative x-ray examinations that indicated a favourable implantation of the prosthesis. The patient underwent standard postoperative physical therapy, including a rehabilitation programme. In addition, the patient received intravenous penicillin and azithromycin for 12 days and subsequent intramuscular injections of benzathine benzylpenicillin at a dose of 2.4 million units per week for 4 weeks. One year later, an RPR test was performed, and the result suggested a negative finding of syphilis.

The patient recovered full mobility without pain after treatment and began weight-bearing exercises. At the follow-up of 1, 3, and 5.5 years after the operation, the patient presented with a pain-free and functional hip prosthesis without local signs of infection and loosening. X-ray examination revealed the prosthesis location was stable without signs of loosening or migration and that bone healing was satisfactory at the acetabular bone graft site. The values of hs-CRP and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were in the normal range.

The patient was discharged in good condition, advised about the importance of follow-up testing, and referred to an outpatient service.",,,0

Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with longstanding back and left leg pain that was resistant to pain management. He suffered a fall with a left wrist fracture and developed shortness of breath, which led to an emergency room visit. He was diagnosed with two right retroperitoneal masses, which were confirmed to be a benign nerve sheath tumor. A genetic evaluation revealed a large contiguous deletion of chromosome 9p21.3, extending beyond the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A) gene and spanning approximately 25 genes. The patient had a family history of multiple melanomas and other malignancies and was monitored for three years, during which the retroperitoneal masses remained stable. However, he developed progressive back and radicular abdominal pain, and the right prevertebral and right paraspinal lesions continued to grow. Given the patient’s condition and predisposition to malignancy, he was referred to interventional radiology for image-guided RFA. Six weeks after the procedure, there was a decrease in the size of the right prevertebral and right paraspinal lesions. The patient reported an improvement in pain and no longer required methadone for pain control. Follow-up imaging four years later showed stable regression of the anterior prevertebral lesion and further decrease in the size of the posterior paraspinal lesion.

Gender: Male
Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]

This is the discharge summary for [REDACTED] who was admitted with intermittent pain in his lumbar region. He was diagnosed with a giant duodenal cyst (GDC) which was successfully treated with a total gastrectomy.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with intermittent pain in right lumbar region, and an epigastric mass was palpated on abdominal examination. An abdominal CT scan was performed which revealed a voluminous mass of 24 x 15 x 13 cm3, partially cystic, located in the epigastric region, between the left lobe of the liver, the stomach, the pancreas and the transverse colon. The differential diagnoses included cystic lymphangioma, cystic mesothelioma, non-communicating GD, and cystic GIST.

A decision for laparotomy surgery was made due to the possible neoplastic degeneration and the difficulties caused by the volume of the mass. During the surgery, a GDC of 30 cm of major axis was highlighted and 2 L of mucus was evacuated. A total gastrectomy with a roux-en-y loop oesophago-jejunostomy and a lymphadenectomy was performed. The histological examination revealed a GDC with no signs of dysplasia or metaplasia present. The immune marking of pancytokeratine was normal with little elevated KI67 proliferation. 18 sampled lymph nodes were free of malignancy.

The postoperative course was uneventful, with a discharge after 10 days. The CEA level was 3.06 mg/L on discharge. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient was well.

Final Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with a GDC with no malignant transformation.

Follow-up Plan:
The patient is advised of a follow-up schedule to assess the successful treatment of the GDC and to monitor his levels of CEA, with a proposed follow-up after 6 months. Any changes should be reported and acted upon promptly.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
The patient, a 78-year-old female with a history of CREST syndrome, presented to the emergency room with hematemesis and mild abdominal pain. She was diagnosed with acute-on-chronic anemia from gastrointestinal bleeding. During her hospital stay, she underwent urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy but no actively bleeding lesion was identified. She was discharged after tolerating liquid food; however, she was brought back to the emergency room for severe lower abdominal pain hours after discharge. The patient was diagnosed with bowel perforation and underwent exploratory laparotomy. Despite the surgery, the patient experienced complications and her family members decided to initiate comfort care.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient presented to the emergency room with hematemesis and mild abdominal pain. Laboratory studies revealed a WBC count of 29X10 ∧3/μl and a hemoglobin of 4.7 g/L. Elevated venous lactate level was noted. She received intravenous fluid resuscitation and empirical piperacillin/tazobactam as well as 2 units of red blood cells transfusion in the emergency room. A subsequent CT scan of the abdomen that showed significantly dilated colon and pneumatosis intestinalis. No surgical intervention was needed. Patient was then admitted to ICU for close monitoring and management of her condition. She underwent urgent esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which revealed Barrett's-type esophageal mucosa and erosive gastritis without actively bleeding lesion; due to this, the patient was discharged home on the 4th day of hospitalization after tolerating liquid food. She was brought back to the emergency room a few hours after discharge due to severe lower abdominal pain and was diagnosed with bowel perforation, for which she underwent exploratory laparotomy. Patchy necrosis throughout the large intestine and a perforated lesion in the ascending colon were identified during the operation. Subtotal colectomy, omentectomy, and end ileostomy were performed. Pathological findings were consistent with colonic perforation with transmural ischemic necrosis and fibrosis. CT angiography and conventional angiogram were performed to determine the culprit artery for bowel ischemia and identified a noncritical stenosis in superior mesenteric artery. The patient was then transferred to ICU for postoperative care. However, her recovery was complicated with ventilation dependent respiratory failure and another episode of bowel perforation, which led to the initiation of comfort care due to her advanced age, comorbidities, and poor prognosis.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1. Gastrointestinal bleeding with acute-on-chronic anemia.
2. Gastrointestinal perforation with transmural ischemic necrosis and fibrosis.
3. Barrett's-type esophageal mucosa and erosive gastritis.

The patient is a 69-year-old man who presented as an emergency outpatient with sudden epigastric pain. The patient has a history of laryngoesophagopharyngectomy, bilateral lymph node dissection for hypopharyngeal cancer, and esophageal reconstruction with a free jejunum flap six years prior.

Physical examination revealed tenderness in the epigastric region with elevated values in blood biochemistry (creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine phosphokinase). Abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT) revealed twisted mesentery with the small intestine around the point of torsion, and the superior mesenteric artery as the axis (whirl sign). Small bowel volvulus was suspected.

Emergency surgery was performed on the same day. Laparoscopic examination revealed the entire part from the upper jejunum to the terminal ileum twisted clockwise, with the superior mesenteric artery and vein as the axes. The surgery involved the separation of adhesion between different sections of the intestinal tract, and tracing of the bowel from the small bowel in the region of the ligament of Treitz toward the anus to confirm the absence of adhesions or torsion up to the terminal ileum. The color of the small bowel improved, and no resection of any intestine was required.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 51-year-old female of Han ethnicity, was admitted to our hospital in September 2018 after developing pain, redness, and hyperemia in her right eye following entry of some cigarette ash. Corneal scraping was performed, and antifungal and antibacterial therapy with levofloxacin eye drops, cefminox sodium, and voriconazole was initiated. After two weeks of outpatient treatment, the patient was hospitalized due to the appearance of a grayish-white ulcer in her cornea.

Diagnostic findings:

The patient underwent a penetrating keratoplasty, and exudation was noted in the anterior chamber post-surgery. Intracameral fluconazole injection was administered, but the infiltrates continued to progressively worsen and remained unresponsive to any treatment. A subsequent enucleation was performed due to persistent infection. A sample of the corneal fragment revealed a positive culture for a fungus that was definitively identified as P. insidiosum by ITS rRNA gene sequencing analysis.

Treatment course:

The patient was treated with antifungal medications and underwent surgical intervention in a bid to relieve her symptoms. Unfortunately, these attempts were unsuccessful, and the patient ultimately required enucleation of the affected eye.

The patient was a 74-year-old male admitted for altered mental status and non-responsiveness. On admission, the patient had an elevated blood glucose and anion gap, as well as hypernatremia, acute kidney injury, and hemoconcentration. Imaging studies showed a right lower lobe mass or consolidation with multiple mediastinal and hilar masses compatible with lymphadenopathy, a suprasellar mass, and nodular densities in the adrenal glands and kidneys. Additional investigations showed small lymph nodes in the parotid glands, a persistent primary respiratory alkalosis with secondary metabolic alkalosis, and endocrine abnormalities consistent with gonadotropin deficiency and hypothyroidism.

Treatment:

The patient was started on half normal saline and insulin for the hyperglycemia. The acute kidney injury improved by day 3, though the hypernatremia did not correct until the patient was started on desmopressin on day 7. Given the significant metastatic burden, the plan was to obtain a lung biopsy and conduct a high dexamethasone suppression test for ectopic ACTH production. However, the patient declined further workup or treatment and opted for hospice.

The patient, a 34-year-old female with a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and attention deficit hyperactive disorder, presented to the emergency department with severe epigastric pain, fevers, and a non-productive cough. She denied any history of dysuria, hematuria, headache, or neck stiffness. After undergoing a series of tests, the patient was initially diagnosed with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to a presumed viral but undetermined etiology with hypovolemia. The patient was treated with a fluid resuscitation, which was administered intravenously over four hours with an improvement in her vitals.

The next morning, the patient complained of worsening symptoms of malaise and weakness. Despite receiving additional fluids, the patient remained hypotensive and required placement of a central line in the intensive care unit (ICU). At this time, she was diagnosed with dehydration secondary to severe sepsis with septic shock. A chest X-ray was ordered which did not show any significant pathology. Blood cultures and an ECG were taken, which revealed questionable ST-segment elevations of lateral chest leads consistent with myocarditis. Troponin I was also found to be elevated.

The patient underwent abdominal CT scan which revealed patchy enhancement of the kidneys concerning for pyelonephritis, but no significant pulmonary edema or cause of sepsis. Unfortunately, the patient decompensated into pulseless ventricular tachycardia and eventual death despite attempts at resuscitation. A postmortem influenza smear was negative for influenza A, parainfluenza A1–A4, and positive for influenza B. This finding, coupled with inflammation of the myocardium on the autopsy, led to the diagnosis of fatal myocarditis caused by influenza B.

The patient was admitted to our department primarily with complaints of hoarseness, dysphagia, and foreign-body sensation, which had gradually worsened over a period of 8 months. The patient was a heavy smoker and consumed alcohol frequently without indulging in alcohol abuse. The patient also had arterial hypertension, which was under control with beta blockers.

After a thorough examination of the head and neck, the patient was found to have a lesion affecting both vocal cords and anterior commissure, with vocal cord mobility being impaired. A cervicothoracic and upper abdomen computed tomography scan was ordered, and the patient underwent direct microlaryngoscopy and biopsy of the lesion under general anesthesia. The biopsy confirmed a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma affecting the anterior commissure and thyroid cartilage. Imaging also revealed a second lesion approximately 2 cm below the inferior end of the primary one, which was resected along with the primary tumor following informed consent.

The patient underwent total laryngectomy, wide excision of the trachea, and left thyroid lobectomy, followed by bilateral selective neck dissection (Robin’s levels II–IV) and removal of the paratracheal lymph nodes (Robin’s level VI). The surgical resection margins were free of disease. After surgery, the patient had an uneventful postoperative course and was discharged on day 16 with normal swallow function.

The final pathological report confirmed that the primary tumor was a glottic carcinoma, while the second tumor had morphological features identical to those of the primary one with an upward infiltrating pattern. The lymph nodes from the left neck dissection specimen showed extracapsular spread, as did many of the neoplastic emboli observed in lymphatics between the two tumors.

Overall Hospital Course:
The patient, a male with a past history of hypertension and hypothyroidism, was admitted to the telemetry unit for abnormal electrocardiogram (EKG) findings on the Holter monitor. The initial presentation did not show any symptoms of chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, or headaches. Physical examination revealed pulse rate of 36 beats/min, respiratory rate of 16/minute, and blood pressure of 180/70 mmHg. EKG showed new-onset atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response, frequent episodes of bradycardia to less than 40 beats per minute, and left bundle branch block.

Diagnostic/Laboratory Results
Initial labs, basic metabolic panel, and complete blood count remained within normal limits. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) was elevated to 74.03 IU/ml, with free thyroxine (fT4) decreased to 0.53 mg/dl. There was also no history of taking any AV nodal blocking agents such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, or digoxin that could cause a slow ventricular rate. Baseline EKG two years ago showed left bundle branch block with first degree AV block.

Treatment and course
The patient was admitted to the telemetry unit, and the levothyroxine dose was increased to 50 mcg per oral daily. A repeat EKG showed atrial tachycardia with a variable high-grade AV block. The patient reported symptoms of dizziness with minimal exertion, and it was planned to insert a pacemaker for a high-grade AV block and symptomatic bradycardia. However, a subsequent telemetry review showed complete resolution of the high-degree AV block and pauses were no longer observed four days after increasing the dose of levothyroxine. Permanent pacemaker insertion was avoided, and the patient was discharged on levothyroxine 50 mcg daily, apixaban 5 mg twice daily for new-onset atrial fibrillation, and was advised to follow-up with a cardiologist for repeat thyroid function testing in four to six weeks.

Diagnoses:
-Hypothyroidism
-Hypertension

Patient Information:
Name: [redacted]
Age: 37
Gender: Female
Admission Date: [redacted]
Discharge Date: [redacted]
Admitting Diagnosis: Increased alfafetoprotein on an integrated biochemical screening test (AFP)

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 37-year-old gravida 2 para 1, was admitted at 19 weeks due to an increased alfafetoprotein on an integrated biochemical screening test. Ultrasound revealed normal fetal growth, but placental lakes were observed. A non-invasive prenatal test (NIPT) was performed and came back normal, and the patient was advised for dietary changes due to gestational diabetes.

At 26 weeks, the patient had a follow-up scan which showed normal fetal growth, but subchorionic placental cysts were observed. The patient had abnormal glucose challenge test and OGTT, which confirmed gestational diabetes. The patient was advised on dietary changes accordingly.

Subsequent scans at 30 weeks revealed that fetal growth had declined, with amniotic fluid being stained and with 2 subchorionic placental cysts located near the umbilical cord insertion. The glucose profile showed suboptimal low glycemic values, and the patient received dietary advice. At 32 weeks, multiple large subchorionic placental cysts were observed, all with intracystic heterogenous material compatible with clotting. Fetal growth had decreased even further.

Due to the sudden change in the placental aspect, the patient was admitted for fetal monitoring, and a repeat c-section was performed at 34 weeks for suboptimal fetal monitoring. A baby girl was born, weighing 1850 g, with an uncomplicated neonatal course.

Placenta Pathology:
The placenta weighed 513 g, measured 16x 15 x 6 cm and had a 50 cm 3-vessel cord. Multiple large subchorionic cysts (measuring each 6 cm), all with intracystic hemorraghe and massive perivillous fibrin deposits were present.

Patient Name: Case 1
Age: 11-Year-Old
Sex: Male
Breed: Border Collie

Hospital Course:

Case 1 was admitted with clinical symptoms of malaise, inappetence, and external signs of internal bleeding. Ultrasonography revealed a large renal mass and the spread of metastasis towards the lungs. The patient was entered into a research protocol that involved high dose oral DHEA and ubiquinone. A rapid improvement in quality of life was observed within a few days of initiation of the protocol.

However, the patient developed a generalized inflammatory condition that affected his nasal passages, skin, and eyes. Skin lesions ranged from nonpruritic maculopapular rash to urticaria, erythema nodosum, and purpura. The oral mucosa was inflamed, and uveitis was prominent. Zinc supplementation did not help alleviate the inflammatory condition.

After studying earlier in vitro work, it was found that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway may have caused the autoinflammatory reaction observed. Administration of oral, encapsulated geraniol led to the rapid clearing of all lesions within 3.5 days. The patient survived 315 days from original diagnosis, with pulmonary metastasis being the cause of death.

Date of Discharge: August 23, 2016
Admitting Diagnosis: Suspected side effect associated with immunotherapy
Discharge Diagnosis: Unresolved neurological symptoms despite extensive treatment, aseptic meningitis

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with suspected side effect associated with immunotherapy. The patient completed six doses of nivolumab without any laboratory or clinical signs of adverse effects, but 14 days following the last dose of nivolumab, he reported a change in behavior and a history of uncontrollable movements. A physical neurological examination revealed mild generalized choreatic movements of his upper extremities and head. Anti-paraneoplastic antigen Ma2 (anti-PNMA2) IgG class autoantibodies were the only positive findings in the CSF examination. Despite high-dose intravenously administered steroid therapy, there was further deterioration of choreiform movements and he developed a paranoid hallucinatory syndrome with suicidal thoughts. Infliximab administration did not have any clinical effect. 

The patient and his family insisted on discharge from our hospital and he was discharged through an against-medical-advice discharge form. He was informed about the importance of doing so, but he did not come for further treatment. The patient was eventually admitted to the standard ward on September 13, 2016, presenting with a fever and soporific state. The autopsy confirmed the histology of clear cell renal cancer with metastatic para-aortic lymph nodes and necrotic Th11 vertebra. A histological examination revealed focal lymphocytic meningitis of the entire brain, the cerebrum, brainstem, and cervical spinal cord, along with multiple perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, which were most prominent in the basal ganglia on both sides.

Admission Reason:
The patient was admitted to our center following a road traffic accident that caused multiple significant injuries, including unstable pelvic fractures and femoral fractures. The patient also had bilateral pneumothoraces, extensive pulmonary contusion, and a splenic hemorrhage.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient was resuscitated using local major hemorrhage protocols and receiving ten units of packed red cells and four units of fresh frozen plasma. To stabilize his condition, he underwent an emergency laparotomy and splenectomy. Due to respiratory distress, the patient was placed on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) from day 15 of his admission for 21 days. On day 21, he underwent an emergency thoracotomy to address a massive haemothorax. The patient was subsequently stepped down to the general intensive care unit on day 36 and was transferred to the ward on day 55 to continue his prolonged rehabilitation and recovery period.

Course of Liver Function:
The patient experienced a modest change in liver function tests during his hospital stay. ALP increased from 55 to 143 IU/L between day 1 and day 6 of hospital admission. Proceeding decannulation, there was a sequential increase in ALP peaking at 2335 IU/L on day 113. The ALT also rose to a lesser extent, peaking at 781 IU/L on day 52. The bilirubin did not rise above 57 μmol/L. Autoantibody screen, immunoglobulins, and viral hepatitis serology were negative.

Diagnostic Imaging:
Serial ultrasound, computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging were performed to exclude biliary stones and sludge. The liver on CT at day 1 showed normal liver and biliary structure, and it was not until 10 months after the admission, the repeat magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) demonstrated a multistenotic pattern of disease within the intrahepatic ducts.

Treatment Plan:
In the absence of significant casts within the biliary tree and no evidence to suggest biliary sepsis, ERCP was not deemed helpful. The patient was given a conservative management approach, and he was instigated on ursodeoxycholic acid to help improve cholestasis. The patient was closely monitored as an outpatient upon discharge for progressive liver disease and dysfunction. Repeat imaging and noninvasive fibrosis assessments were undertaken.

Outcome:
Despite having evidence of SSC, the synthetic liver function has remained excellent, cholestasis markers have improved, and there have been no episodes of cholangitis or biliary sepsis for over 1 year. 

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged after a 4-month admission, including a prolonged rehabilitation and recovery period. The patient was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle and attend scheduled follow-up appointments with his healthcare provider. There were no further instructions provided at the time of discharge.",,,0

The 57-year-old male patient was admitted to our institution with repeated attacks of high IOP and AU in the left eye. The patient had a history of Posner-Schlossman syndrome, which recurred several times two decades ago. The initial outpatient medical records showed BCVA of 20/25 with deep anterior chamber and a few anterior chamber inflammations. The patient was treated with topical corticosteroids and anti-glaucoma medications, but IOP continued to elevate consistently.

On admission, cornea edema with bullous keratopathy, fine white KPs, deep anterior chamber, 2+ flare counts in aqueous and patched iris atrophy were observed in the patient's left eye. Visual field defects and glaucomatous optic nerve defects were also enlarged. Subsequent testing showed CMV-DNA positive in the aqueous sample. The patient was treated with systemic antiviral therapy, topical ganciclovir gel, anti-inflammatory eye drops, and local anti-glaucoma medications. The IOP became normal three days later, and the patient was discharged to follow up.

However, 12 days after cessation of systemic antiviral therapy, IOP reached 33 mmHg despite consistent topical ganciclovir gel, corticosteroid, and NSAID use. The patient was readmitted and treated with additional medication therapies, including systemic antiviral injections, anti-inflammatory vein injections, and anti-glaucoma anterior chamber penetration. However, the IOP remained persistently high, and corneal opacity was observed in the infected eye.

Patient: 70-year-old female referred to our clinic for progressive NTG.

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with NTG with a BCVA of 0.5 and 1.0 in the right and left eyes, respectively. The IOP while on glaucoma drops was 15 and 16 mm Hg for the right and left eyes, respectively. Upon examination, both discs appeared clearly glaucomatous with C/D = 0.8–0.9 and disc hemorrhage was noted on the right side.

The patient underwent an MR scan, which revealed pituitary macroadenoma affecting the chiasm, measuring 24 × 30 × 20 mm. The patient underwent a transsphenoidal resection to remove the tumor. Following surgery, the VF improved very rapidly and has remained stable for 4 years.

Summary:

This case report describes a 70-year-old female who was referred to our clinic for progressive NTG. She was found to have pituitary macroadenoma affecting the chiasm, which was deemed responsible for the bitemporal hemianopia observed in her VF. Following the tumor's removal, the patient's VF improved and has remained stable for four years.

To the best of our knowledge, coexistence of true glaucoma was observed in less than 1% of cases with this medical presentation.

Patient Presentation:
A 44-year-old man presented with visible hematuria, right-sided abdominal pain, and a distended abdomen. He had a known history of large bilateral AMLs associated with tuberous sclerosis and had undergone multiple previous embolizations.

Medical History:
The patient had multiple comorbidities including hypertension, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt, and end ileostomy. He had also undergone neoadjuvant radiotherapy in March 2015 for rectal adenocarcinoma.

Hospital Stay:
Following admission, a Dimercaptosuccinic acid scan was performed, which showed the right kidney contributed 57% and left kidney 43% of the differential renal function, respectively. Renal CT angiography suggested active bleeding from the upper pole of the right kidney, which was confirmed on direct angiography. The patient underwent selective embolization, but his hemoglobin fell resulting in a transfusion of 2 U of red blood cells. Despite this, his hemoglobin levels continued to decline, and he experienced lethargy, malaise, and hematuria.

Diagnostic testing:
Repeat CT was nondiagnostic owing to the presence of contrast in his kidneys from the previous intervention. During repeat direct angiography, the source of bleeding could be lateralized to the upper pole of the right kidney, and as such, it was embolized again. Hemoglobin continued to fall, and further instances of transfusion and fresh frozen plasma therapy were required. While a hemolysis screen was performed, it was negative for hemoglobin degradation products.

Clinical Progression:
The patient was oliguric and hypertensive, indicating a rapidly declining estimated glomerular filtration rate and a four-liter positive fluid balance. He developed disseminated intravascular coagulation, which prompted the introduction of CVVHDF and the administration of piptazobactam and vancomycin. He also required the insertion of a three-lumen central venous catheter into the left femoral vein. While the patient's condition slowly improved over time, he remained hospitalized for 10 days.

The initial differential diagnoses were haemorrhagic metastases (recurrent melanoma) or an atypical presentation of amyloid angiopathy. CT chest identified a mass in the left atrium, which was later confirmed to be an atrial myxoma. Histological assessment was non-contributory towards a diagnosis. The excised material consisted of haemorrhage and some distortion of the underlying vascular architecture, without evidence of vasculitis or amyloid angiopathy. The patient underwent left atrial myxoma excision and therapeutic heparin cover on a cardiopulmonary bypass machine. The patient had an uncomplicated post-operative course and a normal post-operative echocardiogram. She was discharged home with a follow-up MRI and neurosurgical review booked at 6 weeks.

Chief complaint: Diffuse abdominal pain, fevers, myalgia, and nausea.

Hospital course:

The patient, a 49-year-old female, presented to the emergency department with diffuse abdominal pain, fevers, myalgia, and nausea. She had a prior unsuccessful cervical dilation and endometrial biopsy, and was started on oral metronidazole for suspected bacterial vaginosis. On physical examination, severe diffuse abdominal tenderness and guarding were noted. Laboratory results showed mild leukocytosis with white blood cell count of 12 × 10^3/μL, but otherwise unremarkable. The computed tomography demonstrated an intrauterine fluid collection. Ampicillin, clindamycin, and gentamycin were started. Gynecology was consulted and the patient was taken to the operating room for emergent dilation and curettage. However, the procedure was unsuccessful due to complete cervical stenosis and severe uterine tissue inflammation and edema. Repeated ultrasound-guided attempts failed, and a non-perforating iatrogenic false lumen was created in the posterior myometrium. The following day, the patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy. The surgeon reported a tense, fluid-filled uterus that ruptured when bi-valved, consistent with a pyometra. 

Diagnosis:

Diffuse abdominal pain, fevers, myalgia, and nausea due to complete cervical stenosis and severe uterine tissue inflammation and edema resulting in a pyometra.

Treatment:

The patient was started on ampicillin, clindamycin, and gentamycin and taken to the operating room for dilation and curettage. This procedure was unsuccessful due to complete cervical stenosis and severe uterine tissue inflammation and edema resulting in a non-perforating iatrogenic false lumen.

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 39-year-old female who was admitted to our facility for surgical consultation. She presented with right upper quadrant abdominal pain and was found to have a large enhancing mass on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. Percutaneous biopsy revealed moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma. The patient was considered borderline resectable due to the size and location of the tumor, and neoadjuvant therapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin was initiated. The patient received four cycles of chemotherapy and underwent two trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE) procedures. Restaging imaging showed considerable response to therapy with a partial response to liver-directed therapy. A right portal vein embolization was performed, planned as preparation for extended right hepatectomy.

During exploration and resection, all segment 4 branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein were identified and ligated. The tumor was abutting a portion of portal vein bifurcation, and the involved portion of the left portal vein was resected with primary reconstruction to the distal 2/3 portal vein branch. The patient underwent two separate bile duct anastomoses to a retrocolic Roux limb of jejunum for the segment 2 and segment 3 ducts using 6-0 PDS suture.

Patient:
The patient is a 50-year-old female who underwent radical resection of left renal carcinoma and renal hilar lymph node dissection.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a left renal mass, which was identified during an ultrasound examination. Subsequent imaging revealed a 7.9 × 7.6 cm mixed-density mass in the upper pole of the left kidney. The mass demonstrated a slightly high- and low-density necrosis with an uneven enhancement pattern. The left renal pelvis was obscured by the tumor, and an enlarged lymph node was observed in the left renal hilum.

Surgery:
The patient underwent radical resection of the left renal carcinoma and renal hilar lymph node dissection. The resection involved the perirenal fascia, perirenal fat, kidney, ipsilateral adrenal, ureter above the iliac blood vessel bifurcation, and abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava lymph node from the angle of diaphragm to the bifurcation of the abdominal aorta. On incision of the kidney, a 9 × 8 × 8 cm gray-white tumor and atrophied renal parenchyma were observed.

Pathology:
Pathological examination of the resected mass revealed XP11.2 translocations/TFE3 gene fusions associated renal cell carcinoma with a size of 9 × 8 × 8 cm. Vascular regions displayed evidence of invasion by carcinoma. Left renal hilar lymph nodes were found to have metastases (2/2).

Immunohistochemistry:
Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue samples revealed positive expression for CAIX, CD117, Ki67, Melan-A, TFE3, AE1/AE3, and CK8/18. The analysis further demonstrated negative expression for CD10, CK7, HMB, P504 s, Vimentin, EMA, PAX-8, and SMA.

Medical History: Unknown  

Hospital Course:  
The patient was admitted to our hospital with a suspected left parotid gland cancer. The patient complained of a painless nodule in the left parotid region that had increased in size over the past two years. FNA cytology was performed, revealing clusters of epithelial cells with a sheet-like arrangement and high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio. Malignant epithelial cells derived from salivary glands were suspected. An MRI showed a well-defined multilocular tumor located close to the outside of the left parotid gland. The patient underwent tumor resection of the left parotid region and superficial parotidectomy, and the cut surface showed a well-defined lobulated tumor containing yellowish-muddy materials.

Diagnostic Findings:  
Histopathological examination revealed the resected tumor to be a proliferating pilomatricoma composed of basophilic cells and shadow cells apart from the left parotid gland. The tumor was encapsulated by fibrous tissue without stromal invasion. Focal squamous metaplasia, coagulative necrosis and apoptotic cells were also observed. Eosinophilic-stained shadow cells showed nuclear concentration and disappearance, and transitional histological findings were identified.

Immunohistochemical examination showed that basophilic cells and shadow cells were negative for anti-pan cytokeratin antibody and high-molecular-weight keratin, but squamous metaplastic cells were positive. β-catenin was positive for basophilic cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic staining.

Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to our hospital for treatment of gastric polyposis with gastric cancers. He had undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy in another hospital which showed multiple reddish polyps throughout the stomach and biopsy of two elevated lesions in the anterior wall of the corpus and lesser curvature of the angular region, respectively, confirmed the diagnosis of well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. There was no evidence of distant metastasis.

The patient had no significant medical history except for gastric polyposis and no family history of note. The blood biochemical tests were negative for tumor markers. The computed tomography showed gastric wall thickening but no lymphadenopathy. The clinical stage was T1a N0 M0 stage IA according to the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association staging system (14th edition). Colonoscopy showed only a polyp in the transverse colon, with pathological diagnosis of adenoma.

The patient underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with D1+ dissection and Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy. Histopathological examination showed the presence of numerous small and large polyps throughout the stomach in addition to the elevated lesion in the corpus being a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma, and the elevated lesion in the angular region being a well-to-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the submucosa. Additionally, seven of fifty lymph nodes were found to be metastasized by carcinoma cells.

After receiving informed consent, genomic DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens of hamartomatous polyps and carcinoma, and target genes were comprehensively analyzed by next-generation sequencing with a multiple cancer-associated gene panel. The analysis identified somatic mutations in APC, KRAS, TP53, and ERBB2 genes in carcinoma, but failed to detect any germline mutations, including in SMAD4, BMPR1A, or PTEN, in hamartomatous polyps and carcinoma. The final diagnosis was confirmed as juvenile polyposis restricted to the stomach with gastric cancers.

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 8 and has been monitored carefully with no adjuvant chemotherapy, by his request. There is no evidence of recurrence 16 months after surgery.

Diagnosis:

Juvenile polyposis restricted to the stomach with gastric cancers.

Recommendations:

The patient should follow up closely with his medical doctors and monitor closely for any signs of recurrence. He may benefit from genetic counseling and screening for relatives to rule out hereditary polyposis syndrome.",,,0

Chief Complaint:
Acute jaundice and hyperlipidemia.

Hospital Course:
[REDACTED] is a 40-year-old female who was admitted with acute onset of marked jaundice and hyperlipidemia, which developed over a 30 day period. She had a history of menorrhagia and was taking ibuprofen 300 mg bid by mouth for 2-3 days each month for six months. On presentation, the patient had scleral icterus, a soft, non-tender abdomen with a surgical scare, and a palpable spleen. Laboratory testing revealed normal electrolytes except potassium of 3.1 mmol/L, and deranged liver function tests with high levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. The patient was diagnosed with drug-induced liver injury resulting in persistent cholestasis and hyperlipidemia. Due to the further deterioration of liver function tests despite cessation of ibuprofen, she received supportive care and was prescribed polyene phosphatidylcholine, silibinin, glutathione, and ursodeoxycholic acid, in addition to continuation of her diabetic medications. The patient's fatigue and biochemistry improved, and she was discharged after 47 days of hospitalization.

816,"Hospital Course:
The 72-year-old male patient was admitted with persistent pain in the left side of the waist for 2 years. He was diagnosed with schistosomiasis 40 years ago and was also found to have hypertension 1 year ago. The patient had pain on movement of the spine with bilateral Grade IV motor strength in both lower extremities and was diagnosed with a spinal cord and nerve root compression caused by an expanding mass partly protruding into the vertebral canal.

Diagnostic Findings:
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans were performed which showed an elliptical abnormal signal shadow in the left side of the vertebral body and left peritoneum indicative of a dumbbell growth. The MRI scan showed an area of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted images in the T12-L4 paravertebral region. At discovery, a slightly longer T1/T2 signal was observed with a size of 8.6 × 8.4 × 12.4 cm on the left side of the L1 vertebral body. The boundary was clear, and an uneven separation was observed. The lesion protruded into the erector spinae muscles and behind the retroperitoneum. The spinal cord was compressed, and the boundary was clear. Bone destruction was observable on the left lateral transverse process of L2, and the left kidney was significantly compressed.

Treatment:
The patient underwent surgical resection of the total tumor followed by spinal internal fixation of L1 to L2 with pedicle screws. Total laminectomy was performed for L1 and L2. Histopathological examination showed the presence of a lobulated neoplasm in a prominent extracellular myxoid matrix. The neoplastic cells were composed of syncytial cords of ""physaliphorous cells"" that contained abundant pale septated and vacuolated clear to bubbly cytoplasm with mild nuclear pleomorphism. Overt mitosis was not identified. Immunohistochemical examination showed that the lesional cells were positive to CK (+++), S100 (++), CD65 (+), neuron-specific enolase (++), epithelial membrane antigen (+++), and vimentin (+++). The coexpression of epithelial and mesenchymal immunohistochemical markers supported the notochordal lineage of the lesional cells. Ki67 was 3%+ in the lesional cells. The above histomorphological features in conjunction with the immune-phenotype observed confirmed the diagnosis of chordoma.

Outcome:
No heavy ion radiotherapy was performed because the tumor massively invaded into spinal canal and foramen, compressing the spinal cord and nerve root directly. After 5-month follow-up, recurrence was found in the original lesion through the post-operative CT. Due to the complexity and size of the recurrence, a second operation was not possible. At the 15-month follow-up, the patient was deceased after various doctor visits.",,,0

Admission: A 17-year-old female with a recurrent cardiac tumor presented for heart transplant evaluation.

History of Present Illness: Patient initially presented at the age of 10 with dyspnea and holosystolic murmur at apex. Echocardiography revealed a 3.5 × 4.8-cm left atrial mass. A year after the surgery, at the age of 12, she presented to the emergency department with sudden abdominal and right leg pain. Echocardiogram showed multiple cardiac masses in left atrium and left ventricle. Subsequently, she underwent splenectomy and embolectomy. At the age of 13, a right ventricular mass was detected on echocardiography which grew in size and extended into RV outflow tract causing obstruction. She underwent a third sternotomy for tumor resection and specimens were reported as cardiac myxoma. Recurrent cardiac masses in left atrium, left ventricle, and right ventricle were detected on surveillance echocardiography at the age of 15.

Medical History: Patient's medical history was unremarkable with no significant family history, except for a first-degree relative family history of cardiac myxoma.

Assessment and Plan: Due to the infrequent recurrence, fast growing, and the complications from the neoplasm including valve regurgitation and obstruction, and embolic events, heart transplant was proposed with the fourth recurrence of cardiac myxoma. Patient was on the waiting list for 11 months and was finally transplanted at the age of 17. The masses removed from the excision heart showed homogenous tan white, gelatinous, rubbery cut surface and were reported as cardiac myxoma.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 65-year-old male, presented for the first stage of his revision total knee arthroplasty, with a history of multiple periprosthetic infections of the left knee. His past medical history was significant for diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. He had undergone lumbar spinal fusion and multiple failed revision two-stage total knee arthroplasties to treat his periprosthetic infection in the past. Medications during admission included furosemide, gabapentin, carvedilol, lansoprazole, docusate, and enalapril. There was no documented history of allergies or complications with anesthesia.

The patient underwent revision total knee arthroplasty with a tobramycin and vancomycin cement mixture spacer placement. The postoperative management involved the administration of vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. Postoperative cultures revealed that the joint was infected with Corynebacterium striatum, and the patient had developed a nonoliguric acute kidney injury, likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to intraoperative hypotension and nephrotoxic medication side effects from his medications. The AKI progressed to a peak creatinine of 8.62 mg/dl and hyperkalemia at 6.3 mmol/L leading to repeated hemodialysis and ICU transfer.

Tobramycin levels were drawn and emerged as high, which, along with the progress of AKI, led to the explantation of the antibiotic impregnated spacer containing vancomycin and tobramycin. The spacer was replaced with 4 g cefazolin. After the treatment, there was a marked reduction observed in the creatinine level and tobramycin level. The patient was discharged with stable serum creatinine at 2.28 mg/dl without evidence of hyperkalemia or oliguria.

Discharge Diagnosis:

Periprosthetic joint infection (left knee).
Acute kidney injury.

Summary of Hospitalization:

The patient was admitted for the first stage of his revision total knee arthroplasty with a history of multiple periprosthetic infections of the left knee. Postoperative cultures revealed that the joint was infected with Corynebacterium striatum leading to nonoliguric acute kidney injury, likely from acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to intraoperative hypotension and nephrotoxic medication side effects from his medications.

After the explantation of the antibiotic impregnated spacer containing vancomycin and tobramycin, the spacer was replaced with 4 g of cefazolin. There was a marked reduction observed in the creatinine level and tobramycin level after the treatment.

The patient underwent left nephrectomy in January 2014 and had declined high-dose interleukin-2. The patient was started on pazopanib in March 2014 and achieved partial response. A series of drug treatments were administered to the patient from May 2015 to October 2016. In October 2016, computed tomography (CT) scan showed widespread metastases. The patient was offered immunotherapy and received a single dose of nivolumab at 100 mg. The patient developed acute renal failure 2 weeks later. Renal biopsy was not performed as this was a single kidney. The patient was referred to the home hospice service. At the 10th week, the patient unexpectedly walked into the clinic, having felt better a week prior with an increase in urine output. The patient continued to improve, and a contrast CT at week 20 showed dramatic improvement in tumor status. At 6 months post-nivolumab, the patient was doing well without further immunotherapy.

Admission Date: [Date]

Discharge Date: [Date]

Admission Diagnosis: Myocardial infarction

Discharge Diagnosis: Left ventricular free wall rupture

Treatment: Percutaneous coronary intervention, surgical repair of the rupture

Course of Hospitalization:

The patient was admitted to our emergency department with a history of hypertension, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and a carotid endarterectomy. He complained about persisting and progressive angina for two hours, general malaise, and decreased exercise tolerance in the week before hospital admission. His physical examination showed normal cardiac sounds on auscultation, blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, and a heart rate of 90 bpm.

The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, aVF and V5-V6 and ST-segment depression in leads V1-V2. Serum troponin T was significantly elevated at 956 ng/L, creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB) was within normal limits and creatine kinase (CK) was slightly elevated. The patient's coronary angiography revealed single-vessel coronary artery disease, and he underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention of the circumflex coronary with placement of a drug-eluting stent. Following the procedure, the patient achieved a Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grade 2 flow in the AMI culprit coronary artery.

The patient was discharged after a successful percutaneous coronary intervention. However, fifty days after the procedure, the patient experienced progressive fatigue and chest pain with haemodynamic instability. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a covered left ventricular free wall rupture (LVFWR) of the lateral wall and extensive pericardial fluid and inflow obstruction.

The patient was brought to the operation room for an emergent repair of the rupture. The surgical technique avoided damage to the anterolateral papillary muscle (ALPM) and did not result in significant mitral regurgitation. Postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 12 days after the operation.

Result/Follow Up:

More than a year later, the patient did not experience any subsequent cardiac events, and his functional status was similar to the level before the episode of myocardial infarction and rupture.",,,0

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient, a 74-year-old male, was admitted in March 2017 to undergo liver resection for a malignant hepatic lesion diagnosed on CT and PET. The lesion was found in the VIII segment of the liver with three smaller hypodense liver lesions. The case was discussed with radiologists, oncologists, and pathologists of our hospital. Due to the proximity/doubtful infiltration of the lesion to the biliary tree, an explorative staging laparotomy and possible palliative surgery were performed.

As per our internal protocol, a routine liver function test with ICG was conducted to determine the most appropriate surgical procedures. The patient was injected with 45mg of ICG to test hepatic function ten days before the surgery and an adjunctive dose of 9mg of ICG was given the day before the surgery.

During the surgical procedure, the lesion was easily identified and defined on the liver surface using the fluorescent imaging system. The fluorescent imaging also revealed a large area of fluorescent parenchyma that extended from the periphery of the lesion up to the portal pedicle such as the neoplasia would interest the right biliary tree in the form of neoplastic lymphangitis, a datum that was not pre-operatively known.

An atypical segmental resection of S8 associated with cholecystectomy and lymphadenectomy of the hepatic pedicle nodes, including the area of impaired biliary excretion was performed. At the histological examination, the lesion, the lymph nodes of the hepatic pedicle region, and the right biliary branch, respectively, resulted in hepatic metastases from squamous cell carcinoma and sites of metastatic location. As expected, the resection margin was affected by neoplasia.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:

Hepatic metastases from squamous cell carcinoma

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:

The patient is advised to have their post-operative follow-up with their primary care physician. The patient is advised to report any symptoms such as pain, fever, or any drainage from the site of surgery.

Principal Diagnosis: Mitral valve myxoma

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for evaluation of flank pain radiating to the left lower quadrant of her abdomen due to multiple adjacent obstructing calculi in the mid left ureter causing moderate left-sided hydronephrosis. She underwent left ureteral stent placement with no intraoperative events. Given the history of cardiomyopathy, the patient underwent preoperative cardiac evaluation, which revealed a mitral valve vegetation. Antibiotic therapy was started, and a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed, which revealed a noncalcified mass with uniform echodensity located on the atrial side of P2. This led to a differential diagnosis of myxoma, papillary fibroelastoma, liposarcoma, and an infectious vegetation. Left heart catheterization revealed nonobstructive coronary artery disease and mild mitral regurgitation. The decision was made to perform minimally invasive mitral valve excision and valve repair with P2 resection since the risk of embolization is increased with mitral valve masses greater than 1 cm. Histopathological findings confirmed a 9.0 × 8.0 × 6.0 mm myxoma attached to the external valve leaflet. The patient's postoperative course was complicated by respiratory insufficiency likely related to obstructive sleep apnea, which resolved within a few days following the procedure.

Discharge Diagnosis: Mitral valve myxoma

Discharge Instructions:
The patient was discharged home with multidisciplinary outpatient follow-up. The patient was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle, and any questions or concerns should be addressed by the patient's primary care physician or during the scheduled outpatient follow-up.

Medical History: Bilateral cataracts, high cholesterol

Hospital Course:

The patient presented to the clinic with left-sided neck pain radiating to the shoulder, arm and numbness in the second digit. A needle biopsy of the left anteromedial upper arm mass was performed, and determined to be a benign schwannoma. The patient's symptoms worsened over time, and was eventually diagnosed with a C6-7 foraminal disc protrusion causing C7 nerve root compression. 

Treatment:

The patient received a staged surgical approach with resection of the upper arm mass followed by a C6-7 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion. The resection of the upper arm mass was performed first; the tumor was resected without nerve action potential transmission. The patient later underwent a C6-7 ACDF, which included a full discectomy and division of the posterior longitudinal ligament, directly decompressing the left C7 nerve root.

Follow-up:

The patient's motor examination was unchanged after the initial surgery, but his pain had significantly improved. By four weeks post-operatively the patient's triceps function returned to full strength and his strength in the finger flexion of his index finger improved. The only complication was post-operative hoarseness of the voice, which improved by three months post-operatively.

Pathological Findings:

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to the emergency room with altered mental status and emesis. There was a history of polyuria and polydipsia for 2 weeks and 8 to 10 kg weight loss during the previous month. On further investigation, it was found that the patient was suffering from diabetic ketoacidosis.

Hospital Course:
The patient received fluid resuscitation with 30 mL/kg of normal saline and 50 mEq of sodium bicarbonate in the ER. Continuous insulin infusion was started at 0.1 unit/kg/hr. After the patient was transferred to the PICU the patient received isotonic fluid with potassium phosphate and potassium chloride and without any bicarbonate. The patient exhibited severe metabolic acidosis which was managed with close monitoring and serial laboratory evaluations. 

After a few hours of arrival in the PICU, the patient became disoriented and confused and was given one time 5 ml/kg of 3% hypertonic saline due to concern for cerebral edema and she responded well. Afterwards, the patient was given additional doses of 3% hypertonic saline bolus (5 mL/kg) and 0.8 g/kg of 20% mannitol. 

Hyperosmolar therapy was guided with close monitoring of renal function including serum sodium and serum osmolarity. The patient's serum sodium was 135 upon arrival in the ER and 143 at around 11 hrs before the initiation of hyperosmolar therapy and reached to 160 at 71 hrs when hyperosmolar therapy was discontinued. It was normalized to 143 at 131 hrs of admission. Her osmolarity was 298, 305, 335, and 299 at those timings.

MRI brain obtained at 60 hrs of admission showed mild edema of the cortex and sulci and diffuse edema of the pons and midbrain with restricted diffusion in the pons consistent with central pontine myelinolysis also known as osmotic demyelination syndrome. The patient required continued mechanical ventilation and further management in the PICU but eventually required intubation and mechanical ventilation for recurrent apnea.

Hematology workup showed no underlying hypercoagulability. The patient developed bilateral upper extremity deep venous thromboses (DVT) which were attributed as a complication of DKA.

The patient's overall hospital course was complicated, but she became more responsive on day 5, and her support was gradually weaned until extubation on day 7. 

Discharge Condition:
At the date of discharge, the patient was able to ambulate with a walker and speak, and eat without difficulty. The patient exhibited only mild residual dysmetria, trivial ataxia, mild left-sided weakness, and neglect. All deficits subsequently improved.

Admission Diagnosis: Painless lump over the forehead

Discharge Diagnosis: Stage IV hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multiple metastases

Hospital Course:

The patient presented with a three-month history of a painless lump on his forehead, which was initially ignored and eventually became painful. Examination revealed a hard, tender and fixed lump over the frontal region. CT scan demonstrated that the lesion involved both the outer and the inner tables of the frontal bone.

Core needle biopsy showed tumour cells arranged in both trabecular and solid patterns having predominantly eosinophilic cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli and pleomorphism.

Whole body 18-fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET) scan showed a highly avid lesion in the right liver lobe, multiple liver lesions, lung and dorsal vertebrae metastases. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated. Immunohistochemistry was positive for HepPar1 and CD10.

Given the multiple metastases and the detection of HCC as the primary tumour, radical curative surgery and chemotherapy were not considered. The patient’s Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) at diagnosis was 70. After fixation of the vertebral metastasis, his involved vertebrae were irradiated with a dose of 20 Gy in five fractions with 6-MV beam by a single direct field. Sorafenib was initiated as a systemic therapy.

Sorafenib led to clinically visible regression of the forehead lesion and minimally stabilized/progressed the other metastasis sites. Its use also improved the patient's performance status for six months but ultimately the patient succumbed to hepatic failure a year after diagnosis.

Discharge Plan:

The patient is being discharged to home care for symptomatic and supportive measures. Hospice care options were discussed with the patient and his family, and they expressed their desire to have care provided at home. The patient's family was advised to follow up with oncology, pain management and palliative care services for symptom management and psychological support.

He also underwent cervical laminoplasty for ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis 19 years prior. He had no previous history of tuberculosis infection and BCG vaccination history was unknown.

Physical examination revealed vertebral tenderness at the L2/3 level, and laboratory analysis showed a high ESR and CRP level. Imaging studies revealed collapsed endplates of L2/3 and fluid collection in the anterior part of the vertebral bodies.

During his hospital stay, the patient underwent an L2/3 disc biopsy, which was negative for bacteria culture and Ziehl-Neelsen staining. A computed tomography scan showed soft tissue development in the adjacent abdominal aorta at the L3 level.

Treatment:
The patient was started on empirical therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone but later underwent a 2-stage operation due to the suspicion of an infectious aortic aneurysm and spondylitis with adjacent infectious aortic aneurysm.

Admitting Diagnosis: Acute pain in the left hip

Final Diagnosis: Calcific tendinitis of the gluteus medius tendon

Hospital Course:

The above patient was admitted to our institution in April 2013 with acute pain in the left hip following a skiing accident. Clinical examination showed pain and tenderness of the trochanteric region, a normal but painful range of motion, and perithrochanteric calcifications on radiographs. A CT-scan confirmed a well-defined calcification of low density, 18 millimeters in diameter, in the gluteus medius tendon. Given a history of bilateral recurrent calcific tendinitis of the rotator cuff, an ultrasound-guided needle lavage was proposed, and corticosteroid injection was performed. The patient's symptoms resolved within a few days, and no follow-up imaging was performed.

In November 2014, the patient returned with similar complaints, but on the right side. An MRI showed a hypo-intense, sharply defined structure in the gluteus medius tendon, and a radiograph confirmed a calcification. An ultrasound-guided needle lavage of the calcification with corticosteroid injection was performed, resulting in a similar good clinical response.

Patient Information:
The patient is a 40-year-old female who presented with epigastric pain and weight loss. She has a history of RYGB surgery performed 13 years ago for morbid obesity and was recently diagnosed with bilateral metastatic signet cell carcinoma to the ovaries.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with symptoms of epigastric pain and weight loss. CT imaging of the abdomen was unable to reveal the primary source of the tumor. Upper and lower GI endoscopies were performed but were unrevealing for malignancy with the upper endoscopy failing to examine the excluded stomach due to the limited length of the scope. The excluded stomach was subsequently approached using ADBE via the afferent limb of the Roux-en-Y bypass. Biopsies were negative for H. pylori infection and revealed invasive signet cell gastric adenocarcinoma that likely had metastasized to the ovaries. 

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with Stage IV gastric cancer with a large infiltrative ulcerated circumferential mass found in the prepyloric region and antrum of the stomach. Molecular analysis showed a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumor.

Treatment:
The patient is currently undergoing chemotherapy with fluoropyrimidine, plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) for Stage IV gastric cancer.

Follow-up Care:
The patient was discharged with instructions for follow-up care with their oncologist. Instructions were given for managing symptoms related to the chemotherapy. The patient was also advised to undergo genetic counseling and testing due to the significant family history of gastric cancer in her maternal aunt.

Summary:

Medical History:
- Smoking history
- Untreated hypertension

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our facility due to sudden lower abdominal pain. Although the pain subsided half a day later, he experienced abdominal bloating and nausea that gradually worsened. Physical examination revealed epigastric tenderness and a pulsatile, fist-size mass under the umbilicus. Upper endoscopy showed severe edematous stenosis of the duodenum. Contrast-enhanced CT demonstrated severe stenosis at the origin of the celiac artery caused by the midline arcuate ligament, as well as a low-density retroperitoneal mass lesion and dilatation of the branches of the pancreaticoduodenal artery (PDA).

The diagnosis was duodenal stenosis caused by a retroperitoneal hematoma secondary to rupture of the PDA aneurysm. Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are uncommon and are typically attributed to occlusion or constriction of the celiac artery caused by the median arcuate ligament, arteriosclerosis, or fibromuscular hyperplasia. The patient underwent midline arcuate ligamentotomy to improve the stenosis at celiac artery, thereby decreasing hematoma and clearing duodenal obstruction. It was hypothesized that elevated pressure of the PDA resulted in formation and subsequent rupture of an aneurysm into the retroperitoneum, producing the hematoma.

The patient responded well to treatment and was subsequently discharged. Post-treatment plans included follow-up appointments to monitor the patient's overall health and ensure that the condition did not recur.

Medical Record Number: N/A
Date of Admission: N/A
Date of Discharge: N/A

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian female, presented to the emergency department with progressive dizziness, weakness, early satiety, and chest heaviness. A review of symptoms was negative for abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematochezia, melena, and bone pain. The patient had a remote history of acid reflux disease, history of colonic diverticular disease, and regular use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). Physical examination was notable for pallor, tachycardia, and positive fecal occult blood.

Laboratory testing revealed a hemoglobin count of 7.6 g/dL, prompting further evaluation for a gastrointestinal (GI) source for the bleeding. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed erosive gastritis and duodenitis as well as a non-obstructing Schatzki ring at the gastroesophageal (GE) junction. The pathological evaluation of the gastric and duodenal samples was positive for signet ring carcinoma, favoring a presumptive diagnosis of linitus plastica. However, further investigation revealed an invasive lobular carcinoma in the chest wall and peritoneum.

The patient received one unit of packed red blood cells and symptoms improved. She was subsequently started on hormonal therapy with anastrozole, and later on the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor, palbociclib.

Given the high suspicion for a breast primary, a full thickness biopsy of the inframammary nodular lesions was attempted. Additionally, the patient underwent abdominal laparoscopy with peritoneal biopsies from the diaphragm, falciform ligament, and lower pelvic peritoneum. The patient was emotionally distraught and anxious after receiving the diagnosis. She received appropriate support and counseling from qualified providers.

The patient was noted to have metastatic breast carcinoma with marrow replacement, and has been scheduled for routine oncological follow up.

Patient: 65-year-old male with a history of productive cough and progressive dyspnoea.

Diagnosis: Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL)

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with a history of productive cough and progressive dyspnoea. On physical examination, the patient had mild fine bibasilar crackles on lung exam without wheezing. The patient was a 40 pack-year smoker. Laboratory values were normal, except for a lower PaO2 of 74.4 mmHg on room air. The patient's serum soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) level was high (1655 U/mL). Pulmonary function testing revealed severe irreversible obstructive ventilatory dysfunction with normal diffusing capacity of the lung. A CT scan of the chest revealed irregular wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral bronchi, bilateral bronchiectasis, and mediastinal and both hilar lymphadenopathy were noted. Flexible bronchoscopy demonstrated a diffuse irregular surface of the tracheal and bilateral bronchial mucosa and multiple macroscopic submucosal nodules involving the trachea, the distal trachea above the major carina, and throughout the left and right main bronchi. Endobronchial biopsy of the mucosa on the major carina showed a population of small atypical lymphocytes with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei of irregular nuclear contours. These atypical lymphocytes were CD20 positive B-cells co-expressing CD5, blc-2, and Cyclin D1, leading to the diagnosis of MCL. Further PET-CT imaging showed the persistence of FDG-avid lymphadenopathy within the chest, FDG-avid wall thickening of the trachea and bilateral main bronchi, as well as FDG-avid nasopharyngeal soft tissue thickening. Biopsies of the nasopharyngeal mucosa further demonstrated B-cells with the same immunophenotype as the endobronchial biopsy, and 11;14 translocation was confirmed by FISH analysis using a CCND1/IGH probe. Bone marrow biopsy showed an increased lymphocyte percentage of 23%, with 1% of immature lymphocytes, and a positive immunoglobulin rearrangement. Bone marrow flow cytometry demonstrated a surface kappa clonal B-cell population with CD5, CD20, and FMC-7 expression. Taken together, these findings were consistent with an MCL involving the tracheobronchial wall, nasopharyngeal soft tissue, and bone marrow.
  
Clinical Course:
The patient was treated conservatively with supportive care and was referred to a hematologist for further management. The patient and his family were educated on the diagnosis of MCL and the management options available. The patient was advised to stop smoking, and the importance of smoking cessation was discussed. The patient will follow up with the hematologist for further management of his MCL.

Disposition:
The patient was discharged home with palliative care for his MCL. The patient was advised to follow up with the hematologist within a week of discharge. The patient will continue with supportive treatment for his MCL. The patient was educated on the signs and symptoms of MCL progression and was advised to seek medical attention immediately if such signs and symptoms occur. The patient was advised to continue smoking cessation.",,,0

This is a summary of the medical care and treatment provided for the patient during their hospital stay. The patient was admitted to the hospital with pain in the left lateral knee and acute foot drop due to a traffic accident 12 days prior. The patient received neurotrophic drug treatment and was examined for complete foot dorsiflexion, numbness, and weakness. In addition, ecchymoses were seen in the left lateral of knee and calf. The patient did not receive an MRI due to their cardiac pacemaker.

After physical and neurological examination, electromyography (EMG) was performed which showed a deep left peroneal nerve axonal neuropathy, decreased nerve conduction velocity, motor amplitude, and denervation potential in the extensor hallucis longus (EHL) and tibialis anterior muscle (TA). X-ray and computed tomography (CT) were performed which revealed no fractures. Laboratory studies revealed routine blood test results and tumor markers, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were within normal range.

The common fibular nerve was explored surgically which revealed a fusiform cystic mass located within the epineurium and tracking along the deep branches of the peroneal nerve. A longitudinal incision was made on the cystic wall, mucoid material was evacuated from the cystic mass, and part of the cystic wall and synovium were removed. The articular branch was not found. Pathology showed a cystic wall structure with mucoid material, blood vessel scar fibrotic tissue, and neural tissue proliferation. From the operation and pathology report, the diagnosis was intraneural ganglion cyst with tissue hemorrhage and hydrosarca.

The patient was kept non-weight bearing for one month postoperatively with physiotherapy. She reported the return of sensation to the first and second toes three months after surgery and achieved a significant recovery. EMG investigations showed that the nerve conduction velocity improved three months later and the muscle strength was fully restored relative to the contralateral leg. The patient was asymptomatic and able to return to her normal activities at one-year follow-up.

In conclusion, the patient suffered from intraneural ganglion cyst with tissue hemorrhage and hydrosarca due to a traffic accident. After surgery, the patient experienced a significant recovery and was discharged in stable condition. The patient was advised for follow-up appointments to continue the recovery process.",,,0

Hospital Course:

This patient, a 51-year-old woman with a history of morbid obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, and diabetes, presented to the urgent care clinic with a chronic headache that persisted for almost a year. A CT scan of the head revealed no abnormalities, and other potential causes of the headache were ruled out through laboratory tests and imaging. The patient reported a history of head trauma one year prior to symptom onset, but there was no loss of consciousness, and the headache was thought to be related to post-concussion syndrome.

Over the course of the year, the patient visited the emergency department several times with severe headaches, but no underlying cause was identified. The headache was rated as 7/10, intermittent, non-radiating, and throbbing, with frontal location. Treatment with NSAIDs, acetaminophen, tramadol, and Fiorecet had been ineffective.

Upon reconciliation of the patient's medications, it was found that she had been switched from metformin to metformin-sitagliptin almost a year prior to the onset of symptom. Given the temporal association of the medication change and symptom presentation, sitagliptin was discontinued as a trial treatment, and the patient was switched back to metformin. Two days after discontinuation of sitagliptin, the patient reported resolution of her headache.

The patient was subsequently discharged with instructions to follow up with her primary care provider and to report any recurrent symptoms.",,,1

The patient is a 55-year-old male who presented to the hospital with sudden onset of dizziness, diplopia, difficulty closing eyes, and trouble chewing. He was diagnosed with bilateral horizontal gaze palsy, gazed-evoked upbeat nystagmus (UBN), and bilateral peripheral facial paralysis with predominance on the left. Mild ataxia was also noticed on the left upper extremity. Brain MRI revealed new infarction in the right middle cerebellar peduncle and bilateral dorsal pontine tegmentum. CT angiography showed no evidence of significant stenosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. CSF examination was normal, and CSF analysis for oligoclonal band, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody, and aquaporin-4 antibody were negative. Contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler showed evidence of potential right-to-left shunt. Further transesophageal echocardiography revealed a patent foramen ovale (PFO) with a tunnel length of 12.6 mm. No significant arrhythmias were captured during Holter monitor examination in hospital.

- Medical Management:

The patient was prescribed Rivaroxaban 15 mg/d at discharge. Closure of PFO was then administrated.

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 62-year-old male with a history of CLL. He was admitted with rapidly growing systemic lymphadenopathy with high levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein as well as high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor. He was started on chemotherapy but developed febrile neutropenia. Salvage therapy with BR was started, which resulted in complete remission of both SLL and classic Hodgkin LPDs.

Hospital Course Details:

Admission:

Admitted with rapidly growing systemic lymphadenopathy, high levels of lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein as well as high levels of soluble IL-2 receptor. 

Procedure:

The right cervical lymph node was surgically excised.

Tests and Results:

Bone marrow aspirate showed massive infiltration of small lymphocytes. FCM analysis revealed that most small lymphocytes in the PB and BM were positive for CD5, CD19, CD20, CD23 and IG light chain. RT-PCR analysis revealed 2300 copies of Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) DNA per ml of whole blood. A SB analysis showed the same patterns of rearranged IGH bands amongst samples from the lymph node, the PB, and the BM. Imaging studies showed increased FDG uptake in lymph nodes, with a maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) higher than 8.5 in cervical, mediastinal and paraaortic lymph nodes.

Diagnosis:

The patient was diagnosed with CLL (Binet B) with a genetic diagnosis of de novo lymphocyte-rich classic Hodgkin lymphoma with small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). 

Treatment:

The patient was initially treated with fludarabine alone, then with FCR, and kept in partial remission. Two courses of ABVD were unsuccessful, with a persistently high number of circulating B-CLL cells being documented in the PB, despite chemotherapy. The patient was then started on salvage therapy with BR (90 mg/m2 Bendamustine on days one and two, 375 mg/m2 Rituximab on day one), which resulted in complete remission of both SLL and classic Hodgkin LPDs.

Outcome:

The patient was discharged in a stable condition. Complete remission was confirmed in both SLL and classic Hodgkin LPDs by FDG-PET, which has continued for more than one year so far. Follow-up appointments were scheduled with the treating physicians.",,,1

Patient Information:
- Name: [Patient’s name]
- Age: 55 years old
- Gender: Male
- Ethnicity: Caucasian
- Admitting Diagnosis: Stage IVB head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with lung metastasis

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our facility in May 2015, with a diagnosis of stage IVB head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and was treated with concurrent cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy. On a follow-up visit in September 2016, the patient was diagnosed with lung metastases and was enrolled in a clinical trial where he was randomized to pembrolizumab monotherapy.

During the course of pembrolizumab therapy, the patient presented with stiffness, swelling, and pain in the right knee. After analysis of synovial fluid, inflammatory monoarthritis was determined, and the patient was treated with prednisone, resulting in a significant improvement of symptoms. The patient was later retreated with prednisone when bilateral arthritis of the knees and arthritis of interphalangeal joints of both hands developed at a later stage.

Pembrolizumab therapy was discontinued following the patient's clinical deterioration due to protocol limitations that did not allow an increase in prednisone dosage or administration of immunomodulatory drugs. Methotrexate was added to control synovial inflammation, and the patient's symptoms gradually improved. Despite discontinuing pembrolizumab, the patient remained in complete remission.

Diagnosis Upon Discharge:
Inflammatory arthritis attributed to pembrolizumab therapy resulting in inflammatory monoarthritis followed by inflammatory polyarthritis.

Condition Upon Discharge:
The patient's condition improved, and he was released upon completion of treatment.

Treatment:
The patient was treated with prednisone and methotrexate, resulting in an improvement of his symptoms. Pembrolizumab therapy was discontinued due to the patient's clinical deterioration.

Follow-Up Instructions:
The patient should closely monitor his symptoms and report any changes to his physician. He should continue to adhere to a healthy lifestyle that includes proper nutrition, exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive drinking.

Summary of Events:
The patient was a healthy 40-year-old man who presented at the emergency room after a high energetic accident that resulted in multiple fractures and comprehensive soft tissue defects on his left lower leg and foot. A thorough clinical examination, along with diagnostic imaging, revealed numerous fractures, including a Gustilo grade IIIB fracture, a medial malleolus fracture, a Tillaux-Chaput fracture, fractures of the navicular bone, cuboid, and five metatarsal heads, and base fractures of the first and second proximal phalanx.

Within the first thirteen hours after admission, the patient underwent placement of an external fixator and debridement of the proximal medial wound. Subsequently, he underwent two more debridements and was treated with EpigardTM and absorbent dressings.

Within the first 24 hours postoperatively, NIRF imaging was performed, which displayed the area of vital and non-viable tissue. The patient underwent a final debridement approximately 6 days after hospital admission in the same session as definitive soft tissue coverage. Intraoperative imaging showed no difference in the extension of the fluorescent area compared to the previous NIRF imaging.

Throughout his hospital stay, the patient's active extension and flexion of the toes were preserved, as well as sensibility in the toes and forefoot. Disturbed sensibility to touch and pain was identified at the foot sole. No signs of a compartment syndrome were found.

Treatment and Management:
The patient was treated with debridement, external fixation, and temporary wound coverage with EpigardTM and absorbent dressings. Intraoperative NIRF image-guidance was used to identify non-viable skin that needed to be removed. The patient then underwent a free anterolateral thigh flap to cover the defect on the medial malleolus and foot sole, with additional split skin graft placed to cover the superficial defect at the lateral malleolus.

Outcome and Discharge Plan:
The patient was discharged after five weeks postoperatively, and nine weeks later, the patient and flap were doing well. His clinical rehabilitation care was completed, and he was able to mobilize with crutches. At the time of discharge, no complications were recorded.

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with a chief complaint of malaise and hematochezia. A physical examination revealed a 10-cm-diameter hard mass at the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory findings demonstrated severe anemia and elevated tumor markers. A colonoscopy showed a circumferential neoplastic lesion at the ascending colon, which did not allow the scope to pass through. The biopsy reported a moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma.

The patient underwent 4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 with panitumumab. An additional 4 cycles of the same regimen were administered, but the tumor actually enlarged. Radiotherapy of 60 Gy in 30 fractions was administered, and the patient tolerated the treatments well.

After the radiotherapy, the tumor shrank, and the patient underwent right hemicolectomy with D3 lymphadenectomy. Metastatic lesions of the liver or peritoneum were not observed. The transverse colon and ileum at 30 cm proximal from the ileocecal valve were cut and anastomosed.

The macroscopic exam of the resected specimen showed a 9.0 × 7.0-cm circumferential tumor with a 4.5 × 3.5-cm ulcer at the ascending colon, which extensively penetrated the colon serosa and infiltrated the ileum and the ovarian vessels. Histopathologically, the primary tumor of the ascending colon and enlarged regional lymph nodes consisted in its totality of granuloma-like or fibrous tissues, and no residual cancer cells were found. Pathological findings revealed complete response, and the final findings were ypT0, ypN0 (0/15), and ypStage0.

After undergoing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatogram (ERCP) and cholecystectomy, the patient continued to experience symptoms. Repeat imaging indicated common bile duct narrowing, and a 20 x 3.5 cm perihepatic abscess was found requiring treatment through percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) and biliary drainage. Laboratory studies at that time revealed elevated white blood cell count, low hemoglobin levels, and abnormal sodium, potassium, albumin, lipase, and AST/ALT levels. After receiving antibiotics for three weeks, the patient was discharged.

One week later, the patient developed a fever, chills, and leukocytosis and was readmitted to the hospital. Abdominal CT showed multiple fluid collections within the liver parenchyma and a biopsy was performed, showing an epithelioid to spindle cell neoplasm infiltrating between hepatocytes with markedly atypical nuclei and prominent necrosis. Further staining was performed and the tumor cells were negative for various markers. Based on the radiographic features in combination with the biopsy results, it was likely a primary hepatic lesion without differentiation.

A PET/CT was ordered after reviewing the biopsy results and identified a large hepatic mass with potential central necrosis and multifocal liver lesions with hypermetabolic peritoneal implants suggesting peritoneal dissemination.

Admission Diagnosis: Complete AV block with a ventricular rate of 43/min

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with dizziness that had persisted for 2 days. Electrocardiography (ECG) revealed complete AV block with a ventricular rate of 43/min. Evaluation via echocardiography and chest computed tomography revealed about a 4.0 × 2.0 cm-sized hypoechoic mass that was protruding into the right ventricle from the interventricular septum, in the vicinity of the AV node. Magnetic resonance imaging of head and neck revealed a recurred mass in the patient's oral cavity and maxillary sinus, while FDG-PET showed a hypermetabolic lesion in both the oral cavity and heart around the interventricular septum and the atrioventricular node.

Temporary pacemaker insertion did not successfully restore sinus rhythm, so a permanent pacemaker of DDD type was implanted. The patient was later referred to the oncology department for palliative chemotherapy.

Follow-up:
There was no definite evidence of recurrence for six months following the patient's complete surgical excision to treat the previous tumor.

Patient Information:
Name: [Name]
Age: 48
Gender: Male

Medical Report:
The patient was admitted with multiple hepatic tumors, including a giant tumor, superior to the inferior vena cava. A laboratory workup on admission showed mildly increased concentrations of liver enzymes but normal levels of total bilirubin and albumin. Imaging studies revealed well-defined, hypoechoic masses in segment 1, S6, and S2 of the liver. Dynamic CT showed a low-density mass with an irregular margin and peripheral early ring enhancement in the arterial phase and internal heterogeneous enhancement in the delayed phase. MRI showed low-intensity signals on T1-weighted images and high-intensity signals on T2-weighted images. On the basis of these imaging findings, a preoperative diagnosis of multiple scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas characterized by abundant fibrous stroma was made. However, after a histopathological examination, the tumor was found to be hepatic sclerosing hemangioma, a rare type of hepatic hemangioma composed of abundant acellular hyalinized tissue with small vessels seen occasionally.

Treatment:
Caudate lobectomy of the liver and partial hepatectomy of S2 and S6 were performed, and the patient tolerated the procedure well. Following the surgery, the patient was discharged on the 14th day post-operation and advised for follow-up visits.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

The patient was admitted with a complaint of patchy hair loss on the scalp, which was subsequently diagnosed as alopecia areata and treated with topical steroids. Four months posttreatment, the patient presented with intermittent fever, cough, and weight loss over the past 45 days. On examination, the patient was pale and cachexic with hepatosplenomegaly (16cm and 16.4cm, respectively). There was no cyanosis, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, or pedal edema. Alopecia over the scalp was regressing. Investigations showed anemia, elevated acute-phase reactants, serum LDH levels, and hypoalbuminemia. Subsequent imaging tests identified enlarged abdominal and thoracic lymph nodes, leading to a preliminary diagnosis of lymphoma. Bone marrow study showed no evidence of infiltration, and a laparoscopic biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma.

On the sixth post-laparoscopic day, the patient had two episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by altered sensorium. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain was suggestive of pontine demyelination; however, there was no evidence of tumor deposits in the brain. Vitamin supplementation was initiated due to the patient's malnourished state. The neurologist suggested that the demyelination was a paraneoplastic manifestation of Hodgkin's lymphoma, and the patient was started on high-dose Methylprednisolone. Later, the patient was diagnosed with HSV-2 infection through CSF analysis after presenting with a high-grade fever with seizures. He received IV Acyclovir and continued on antiepileptics (Levetiracetam & Phenobarbitone) with controlled seizures. The patient sustained neurological deficits (spasticity & dystonia) and was started on chemotherapy (ABVD) once his general condition improved. Abdominal lymph nodes and hepatosplenomegaly regressed following chemotherapy, and his functional ability improved over time.

This 48-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital due to symptoms of liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with massive ascites. The patient had a history of chronic active hepatitis that was treated with prednisolone and azathioprine. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) showed a stricture in the common bile duct which was interpreted as possible extrahepatic primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). After 20 years with fluctuating transaminases and no recorded major clinical events, she developed general edema and thoracic spider nevi. A computed tomography (CT) scan revealed liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension with massive ascites.

Treatment:

After an initial response to symptomatic treatment, the patient soon developed uncompensated liver failure with severe hepatic encephalopathy and was transferred to the national transplant unit for work-up and listing for liver transplantation. A few days later, an ABO-identical donor liver was available and a liver transplant was performed with a duct-to-duct biliary anastomosis. The histopathological examination of the liver explant revealed cirrhosis and pathological changes typical for underlying PSC. Cholangiocarcinoma in situ was found in the common bile duct, the cystic duct, and the common hepatic duct, involving the resection margin. An ERC with brush cytology from the duct-to-duct anastomosis after 6 months showed mild to moderate epithelial dysplasia in the common bile duct. After discussion in the multidisciplinary team, a pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) was decided due to the risk of development of cholangiocarcinoma. Ten months after the liver transplant, the procedure was performed. The surgical specimen showed intestinal metaplasia in the common bile duct, but no dysplasia or carcinoma.

Follow-up:

The patient was followed according to standard post-liver transplantation follow-up regimen. The patient developed insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and received tuberculostatic treatment due to disseminated tuberculosis (pulmonary and meningeal), but the graft function remained good. At the 5-year post-transplantation control, recurrent PSC in the graft was diagnosed on liver biopsy. The patient reported increasing abdominal distension, anorexia, weight loss, and fatigue for the past 6 to 8 months at 10 years of follow-up. Clinical examination revealed extensive sarcopenia, multiple spider nevi, and tense ascites.

Diagnostic Work-up:

Biochemical tests showed an iron deficiency anemia with high liver function tests, inflammatory markers, and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Imaging, including liver and abdominal ultrasound, CT enterography, and PET-CT unveiled liver graft fibrosis/cirrhosis with features of portal hypertension, massive low-attenuating heterogeneous ascites, a focal wall thickening in the middle part of the jejunum, multiple focal lesions in both lungs, a focal lesion in the thyroid gland, and the previously described cystic mass in the lower right abdominal quadrant. Diagnostic abdominal paracentesis revealed thick gelatinous ascites, which was culture negative. The ascites was rich in mucin, but without neoplastic cells on repeated cytology examinations.

Management:

Due to the differential diagnosis of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP), the multidisciplinary team accepted the patient for explorative laparotomy and potentially cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (CRS-HIPEC). Perioperatively, the peritoneal cancer index (PCI) was estimated to 28 of 39, and it was found that CRS-HIPEC was technically doable and meaningful. Surgery included removal of considerable amounts of mucinous masses, extensive peritonectomy, HIPEC, and removal of the umbilicus. The histopathological examination showed perforated low-grade appendiceal mucinous neoplasm and widespread mucin without viable tumor cells in all abdominal specimens, compatible with PMP. Forty-two days after surgery, the patient was readmitted with urinary tract infection, anemia, high glucose levels, reversible kidney failure, weight loss, and malnutrition. She recovered on antibiotics and supportive treatment and received follow-up by nutritionists after discharge. Two months after surgery, she had started regaining weight and transplant control displayed satisfactory graft circulation and function.",,,0

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, patient was made nil per os and started on intravenous hydration. Abdominal ultrasound showed a distended gallbladder (GB) with sludge, thickened GB wall, and positive sonographic Murphy sign, leading to a diagnosis of acute cholecystitis. Intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam was initiated. Intra-operatively, the GB was thickened and firm but not overly distended or perforated. The GB was dissected from the liver edge, and a liver biopsy was performed successfully. The pathology report from the cholecystectomy revealed chronic cholecystitis with amyloid deposits in the GB submucosa and serosa, as well as abnormal plasma cells with lambda light chain restriction. A liver biopsy also exhibited abnormal plasma cells in periportal locations with lambda light chain restriction.

Discharge Summary:
The patient was sent home with comfort measures after declining any further treatment for MM and deciding to proceed with hospice care. The discharge summary showed chronic cholecystitis with amyloid deposits in the GB submucosa and serosa, which was diagnosed intra-operatively.

Hospital Course: 
The patient is a 69-year-old man with type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, end stage renal failure, CMML, dyslipidemia, and obesity. The patient presented to the emergency room with a 3-day history of ongoing macroscopic hematuria. Upon physical examination, the patient was afebrile and his vital signs were within normal limits. He was diagnosed with hemorrhagic cystitis and prescribed ciprofloxacin, which resolved the macroscopic hematuria. However, in September 2017, the patient experienced another episode of macro-hematuria and was prescribed ciprofloxacin again. Despite antibiotics, the patient had symptoms related to UTI and a urine sample for culture was obtained. A multi-drug resistant Myroides odoratimimus strain was isolated from the urine culture. The patient was then treated with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and the urinary catheter was ultimately removed to decrease the possibility of recurrent UTIs. The patient was found to have a strong biofilm-producing bacteria which contributed to an increase in vivo of its virulence.

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 54-year-old male with a history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus was admitted with lethargy and confusion. The patient had a prior hospitalization for orthostatic hypotension and was eventually discharged to a skilled nursing facility but returned to the hospital three days later with an acute change in his mental status. On presentation, he had a respiratory rate of 26 breaths per minute, a heart rate of 62 beats per minute, blood pressure of 121/73 mmHg, a temperature of 37°C, and oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. Laboratory investigation revealed thrombocytopenia and further workup was significant for an anion gap of 40 and LA of 18.7 mmol/L. He had also developed acute renal injury and liver enzymes were elevated. The patient was initiated on sepsis bundle with IV fluids and broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as microbial cultures, including the collection of two sets of blood cultures.

After several days of hospitalization, the patient developed multiorgan failure with persistent encephalopathy, despite discontinuing all sedation, coagulopathy, worsening liver enzymes, and cytopenia. A bone marrow biopsy was performed to evaluate for marrow erythrocytic phagocytosis as there was a concern for thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) or hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). Hemophagocytosis was not identified but the bone marrow contained a monomorphic cellular infiltrate with areas of necrosis and cellular degeneration. The infiltrate was positive for CD45, CD20, and CD79a, and negative for CD34, with patchy non-specific staining for TdT. The Ki67 (MIB-1) proliferation rate was up to 60%. The disease was classified as Ann Arbor stage IV due to its presence in the extra-lymphatic organs (liver and bone marrow). The age-adjusted international prognostic index (IPI) score was calculated to be 3, conferring high risk.

Treatment for the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was planned, but unfortunately, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate, and he became bradycardic and hypotensive, eventually requiring multiple vasopressors. After discussions with the family, comfort measures were pursued.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital due to mild horizontal diplopia in the left direction followed by headache seventeen days later. Upon physical examination, the patient was found to have isolated left abducens nerve palsy. Computed tomography (CT) scanning revealed soft-tissue density neoplasms filling the sphenoidal sinus. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning with gadolinium injection was performed and revealed a homogeneous mass lesion occupying the sphenoidal sinus and invading and destroying the clivus. Rhinoendoscopy revealed a mass at the sphenoidal sinus which was biopsied and histological examination revealed a malignant lymphoma. The pathological diagnosis was Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKL).

The patient was diagnosed with Stage IV ENKL. Ten days later, the patient developed B symptoms, including fever and night sweats. The enlarged lymph nodes were checked in the neck, bilateral subclavian, alar, and inguinal. Contrast-enhanced CT showed renal metastases. Bone marrow smear and biopsy showed active hyperplasia, immature lymphocytes accounting for 3%, and heterotypic large cells having a scattered distribution. Flow cytometry analysis showed lymphocytes accounting for 6.8% and suggested phenotypic abnormal NK cells in the bone marrow. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed no malignant cells.

The patient's plasma Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) yielded 1.18 x 106 copies per milliliter. The second bone marrow biopsy suggested hemophagocytic syndrome. The patient was transferred to the community hospital.

The patient is an 11-year-old male with a history of Alagille syndrome and a liver transplant. The patient presented with a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, and phono-/photophobia without B symptoms. Funduscopic examination revealed bilateral papilledema. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of the brain demonstrated multifocal lesions in the left hemisphere. The patient was diagnosed with EBV-related primary CNS PTLD after a biopsy of the lesion was carried out.

During initial treatment with dexamethasone, symptoms rapidly improved. Immunosuppression was stopped, and immune-/chemotherapy was initiated, including six doses of intravenous (i.v.) rituximab and weekly intrathecal (i.th.) therapy with rituximab (40 mg), methotrexate (12 mg), cytarabine (30 mg), and prednisone (10 mg) over 10 weeks. A partial response was observed after 3 weeks, which evolved into complete remission at the end of immuno-/chemotherapy.

Afterward, the patient underwent a procedure wherein partially HLA-matched EBV-CTLs were transferred due to poor prognosis and the lack of EBV-specific T cells in the patient’s peripheral blood.

The patient was, therefore, discharged in stable condition. Appropriate medications and follow-up assessment were advised, and the family was provided with appropriate instructions for their care at home.

Diagnosis at Admission: Ectopic Molar Pregnancy

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to the hospital from a local clinic with a history of high serum beta-Human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) level but no visible intrauterine gestational sac. A gynecological examination revealed a closed cervical os and mild adnexal tenderness. The patient's first pregnancy had ended with a full-term delivery approximately nine years earlier. A grayscale transabdominal ultrasound showed an empty uterine cavity, but a round hyperechoic lesion was identified in the anterior inferior wall of the uterus. The patient underwent a careful dilatation and curettage (D&C) procedure. The histopathological results confirmed an ectopic molar pregnancy. The patient was scheduled for methotrexate therapy but had to undergo an magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination due to high β-hCG levels. The MRI demonstrated a lesion showing peripheral contrast enhancement on T1-weighted fat-suppressed axial images. The differential diagnosis included a malignant GTD, and surgery was planned. Selective uterine artery embolization was performed immediately before the surgery to reduce the risk of intraoperative bleeding, and a total abdominal hysterectomy was then performed. The patient was diagnosed with choriocarcinoma. A metastatic workup revealed multiple lung metastases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was planned, and the patient received four cycles of the EMA/CO regimen (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine). The patient tolerated the therapy well, and weekly serum β-hCG measurements showed a significant drop, from 12.459 mIU/ml after the surgery to 0.7 mIU/ml following chemotherapy. A follow-up CT scan showed a significant reduction in the size of the lung metastases.

The patient was admitted with stage IV BRAF V600E mutated malignant melanoma. He initially presented with multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, bone and cutaneous lesions, peritoneal metastases, and a lesion at the head of the pancreas. He underwent a palliative combination therapy with a BRAF- and MEK inhibitor. Later, a CT-scan revealed a partial remission of the lung, bone, and cutaneous lesions, but a progression of the lesion in the pancreas. He underwent an irradiation of the pancreatic lesion, and the combination targeted therapy was continued. After eight months, a progression with several new pulmonary lesions and peritoneal metastasis was observed, and he was started on a second-line therapy with ipilimumab. After two cycles, a disease progression prompted a third-line therapy with pembrolizumab and radiotherapy of a myocardial metastasis.

At the 24-month follow-up under pembrolizumab, the patient reported NYHA II dyspnea, and a routine CT-scan showed multiple bilateral part solid lung lesions in the upper parts of the lung. Wedge resection of several nodular lesions of the lung was performed, and it was found that one pulmonary lesion represented a melanoma metastasis with almost complete regressive necrosis as a sign of excellent response to treatment. The other lesions distant to the metastasis represented circumscribed areas of OP. We observed a strong CD3+ cell infiltration of the inflammatory lesion with predominantly CD4+ cells over CD8+ cells, and several FOXP3+ cells were found. Interestingly, clusters of PD-L1 positive macrophages were seen. A course of antibiotics and corticosteroids was initiated, followed by a combined immunosuppressive therapy consisting of mycophenolate mofetil and TNFα-blocking agent infliximab.

After six months, infliximab was stopped, and the patient is currently in a very good partial remission for his melanoma.

Principal Diagnosis: Adrenocortical carcinoma, oncocytic type (pT2)

Hospital Course:

A 37-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital for follow-up after inguinal hernioraphy and varicocele surgery. A high resolution diagnostic Computed Tomography (HRCT) showed a large isodense mass in the left upper abdomen measuring 19 cm in short axis diameter with areas of hypo-attenuation inside. The initial blood and biochemistry investigations were nearly normal, and a bulky adrenal mass raised the possibility of adrenal carcinoma. F-18 FDG PET/CT was requested for detection of a possible additional site of involvement.

The FDG-PET-scan was performed after 6 hours fasting and serum glucose level was 68 mg/dl prior to the scan procedures. The PET scanning was started 60 minutes after intravenous administration of 370 MBq (10 mCi) of F-18 FDG. CT scan was obtained without oral contrast and no IV contrast was given. The maximum intensity projection-MIP-PET and PET-CT fused images in coronal and transaxial projections showed left bulky retroperitoneal mass with heterogeneous intense FDG uptake and central photopenic areas within the mass. Additionally, the PET and PET-CT fused images in transaxial projections demonstrated an intense focal FGD uptake within the right thyroid lobe and low-grade FDG uptake in the distal portion of the esophagus suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux disease. The left kidney was dislocated and was identified in a horizontal position immediately below the inferior pole of the suprarenal mass. The biopsy results of the left adrenal gland showed adrenocortical carcinoma, oncocytic type (pT2). Fine needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid nodule showed papillary thyroid cancer, and total thyroidectomy was performed. Pathology specimen revealed well-differentiated papillary thyroid cancer, classic type (pT1N0).

The patient underwent laparotomy and total left adrenalectomy was done. The post-operative course was uneventful. The patient was advised on follow-up visits in the surgical and medical oncology clinics.

Summary of Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital in February 2013 with complaints of weakness, weight loss, dryness of the eyes, and enlargement of lymph nodes. Her medical history was consistent with a 20-year course of Sjogren's Syndrome. Laboratory tests showed elevated levels of serum lactate dehydrogenase and reduced levels of C4 complement. The patient's diagnosis of Sjogren's Syndrome was confirmed based on the clinical, serological, and pathological features.

The patient was found to have monoclonal immunoglobulin M kappa with properties of cryoglobulin. Urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation assays revealed the presence of monoclonal free kappa type light chains. Full staging computerized tomography (CT) scan showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes and mild splenomegaly. Histologic examination of the right axillary lymph node revealed a completely effaced architecture. The patient was diagnosed with concomitant RDD and plasmacytic marginal zone lymphoma.

After undergoing six cycles of MDB, a partial response was achieved, and a follow-up analysis performed did not detect any presence of monoclonal IgM kappa. One month after chemotherapy, a fast-growing firm mass developed in the left mandibular fossa spreading anteriorly to the parotid area. Peripheral paralysis of the facial nerve also occurred. Histological examination of this mass revealed a necrotic tissue interspersed with foci of small lymphoid cells with scarce large tumor cells. Large tumor cells were also present as perivascular and perineural clusters. The resulting condition was considered a transformation of NMZL into an EBV-positive DLBCL, NOS.

1248,"DISCHARGE SUMMARY:

This is a summary of the hospitalization of a 52-year-old female patient who was admitted to the hospital after undergoing a craniotomy for brain abscess drainage. The patient was noted to have hyperpigmented lesions on the abdomen and upper thighs, which were later diagnosed as erythema ab igne due to the use of a heating pad for over three years to alleviate lower abdominal pain caused by uterine fibroids.

HOSPITAL COURSE:

Upon admission, the patient's mental status was impaired, rendering her unable to give a medical history. The primary care team noted that the skin lesions had been present since admission, but their exact duration was unclear. On examination, the patient had lace-like hyperpigmented patches on the lower abdomen and upper thighs.

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT:

Erythema ab igne was diagnosed, and the care team reassured the primary team that the condition was benign. The patient's husband, who was later available to give further information, revealed that the skin lesions were likely due to the prolonged use of a heating pad. The patient was advised to discontinue its use and was discharged shortly after.

FOLLOW-UP:

The patient was discharged with instructions to follow up with her primary care provider to monitor the hyperpigmented lesions. No further treatment was deemed necessary.

Hospital Course:

A 20-year-old virgin female patient was referred to the hospital in March 2017 due to chronic pelvic pain and severe menstrual cycle pain with a VNRS of 9 lasting for almost a year. The patient had no history of dyschezia, pain during or post-urination, or other symptoms related to diaphragmatic endometriosis.

The patient was diagnosed with endometriosis involving the anterior and posterior cul-de-sac, both pelvic side walls, both ovaries, and sigmoid colon following laparoscopy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted to exclude left mass from adenocarcinoma, while the results revealed normal upper abdominal organs, lungs, and endometrium in both adnexae.

During laparoscopy, the patient underwent pelvic Die correction, and a 2-cm endometriotic nodule attached to the rectovaginal septum was shaved. There was no evidence of endometriosis in the ureters.

Endoscopic fulguration was performed using bipolar energy for endometriotic lesions of the diaphragm when the patient was placed in a reverse Trendelenburg position. There were five to six areas of superficial endometriosis on the anterior and center of the right hemi-diaphragm, but the left hemi-diaphragm was intact.

Anatomy of pelvis was restored, and the patient was discharged in a stable condition.

Procedures:

1. Laparoscopy
2. Fulguration of endometriotic lesions on the diaphragm using bipolar energy
3. Pelvic Die correction

Diagnoses:

1. Endometriosis involving anterior and posterior cul-de-sac, both pelvic side walls, both ovaries, and sigmoid colon

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Gender: Male
Age: 32

Hospital course:

The patient presented with gynecomastia and breast pain, which had been persisting for two years. He had previously seen a gynecologist, endocrinologist, and urologist, who had conducted a breast ultrasound, MRI of the neurocranium, and abdominal ultrasounds and MRIs, respectively. The urologist had performed a physical exam and ultrasound of the abdomen, but results were inconclusive. The endocrinologist diagnosed him with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism with elevated estradiol and prolactin levels. 

Physical examination did not show any abnormalities apart from bilateral gynecomastia. Ultrasound revealed a hypoechogenic mass within the right apical testis, which appeared non-malignant based on frozen section. The tumor was later excised through testis-sparing surgery, which confirmed a Leydig cell tumor, a type of testicular tumor that is usually benign. Chest and abdominal CT scans did not show any signs of malignancy. 

Outcome:

After surgery, the patient reported that gynecomastia had not regressed, but a decrease was observed six months after the operation. The patient lost 12 kg, and sexual hormone levels were within normal range. Biannual follow-up visits were recommended for the first two years, and then annual check-ups. Chest and abdominal imaging were to be conducted every two years. 

Conclusion:

The patient had bilateral gynecomastia, for which he had various consultations and diagnostic tests over a period of two years. Testicular tumor appeared during the examination and was successfully removed through testis-sparing surgery with no signs of malignancy. The patient showed improvement after the surgery, lost weight, and hormone levels stabilized to normal range. Follow-up visits and imaging recommendations were provided.",,,0

Admission Date: [Date]    Discharge Date: [Date]

Hospital Course:

The patient is a 68-year-old Japanese male who had a subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection and the removal of the remnant stomach with the abdominal lymph nodes due to intrathoracic esophageal cancer (T3, N2, M0, stage III) history. The alimentary continuity was reconstructed with a pedicled jejunal limb through the antethoracic route. The surgery was successful, and the patient was discharged four weeks postoperatively.

The patient was readmitted to the hospital six months post-surgery because of abdominal discomfort and vomiting. The patient was diagnosed with Intrathoracic Pedunculated Herniation (IPDH) after an enteral contrast study showed a bird’s beak deformity. A Computed Tomography scan of the thoracoabdominal region confirmed that the reconstructed jejunum was in the pericardium anterior to the heart. An emergency laparotomy was performed, and it was found that the reconstructed jejunum had herniated into the pericardium through an approximately 4-cm-diameter diaphragmatic defect without a hernia sac. The herniation was easily reduced, and the congestion of the incarcerated jejunum resolved. Primary closure of the diaphragmatic defect was accomplished using vertical mattress sutures with 1–0 silk. The diaphragm adhered to the pericardium around the diaphragmatic defect; thus, these were closed together. To reinforce the closure of the diaphragmatic defect, an 8 x 6 cm graft from the rectus abdominis posterior sheath was used, and interrupted sutures with 3–0 nylon were placed to fix the graft to the diaphragmatic defect.

The postoperative upper gastrointestinal study confirmed free flow of contrast medium from the cervical esophagus into the intra-abdominal jejunum through the pedicled jejunum. The patient had an uneventful recovery, and he was discharged on the seventh postoperative day.

Diagnosis:

Intrathoracic Pedunculated Herniation (IPDH)

Procedures:

- Subtotal esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection
- Removal of remnant stomach with abdominal lymph nodes
- Hernia reduction
- Primary closure of diaphragmatic defect using vertical mattress suture with 1-0 silk
- Use of an 8 x 6 cm graft from the rectus abdominis posterior sheath
- Interrupted sutures with 3-0 nylon to fix the graft to the diaphragmatic defect

Condition at Discharge:

The patient was in stable condition with no complaints of abdominal discomfort or vomiting. The patient's vital signs were unremarkable. The patient was given postoperative instructions and advised on further follow-up appointments with his primary care physician.

DOB: [REDACTED]
Chief Complaint: Intermittent bleeding of the right eye

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented to the ophthalmic ward with intermittent bleeding of the right eye and a strong odor. Physical examination revealed narrow conjunctival sac in right eye and exposure of ocular prosthesis discharging yellow-green secretion with a strong odor. Imaging workups revealed swelling in the tissue surrounding the right eye and soft tissue of the lacrimal gland area, suggesting inflammatory disease. Further investigations revealed a partial artificial eye infection, possibly due to anaerobic organism infection.

Past Medical History:
The patient had undergone a right ophthalmectomy 24 years previously due to retinoblastoma and implantation of an artificial right eyeball in 2014. He had no history of drug-use but was a heavy smoker.

Hospital Course:
After removal of the right artificial eye with debridement, both the artificial eye and specimens of the eye secretions were sent for bacterial culture under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, which revealed the presence of Staphylococcus aureus and Helcococcus ovis DSM 21504 T DSM. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed, and the patient was initially treated with intra-venous cefotaxime and ornidazole for one week, followed by levofloxacin eye drops until discharge from the hospital. Two weeks post-admission, the patient recovered and was discharged from the hospital. 

Follow-up:
The patient returned to the hospital six months later for implantation of the artificial right eyeball, and no signs of infection were detected. Samples were collected from the skin around both eyes for aerobic and anaerobic culture, but only normal skin flora were detected, such as coagulase-negative Staphylococcus.

Conclusion:
The patient experienced intermittent bleeding of the right eye due to prolonged exposure of the ocular prosthesis, leading to partial artificial eye infection with Staphylococcus aureus and Helcococcus ovis DSM 21504 T DSM. The patient was treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy and recovered without any complications. Follow-up culture revealed no signs of infection, and no further interventions were required.",,,0

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Medical Record Number: [REDACTED]

Hospital Course:
The patient is a 69-year-old female who presented with worsening cough and pain wrapping around her chest to her back, initially thought to be related to an exacerbation of her chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). When there was no improvement in her symptoms with treatment of COPD, a spinal MRI was ordered to explore possible etiologies of her pain. Later, the patient was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction due to hypertensive emergency and was admitted to the hospital. During the admission, she was noted to be experiencing neck pain, bilateral upper extremity pain in a C8-T1 dermatomal distribution and a loss of urinary and fecal urges. On examination, the patient’s force of flexion and abduction in her upper extremities were mildly reduced. The strength in her lower extremities was decreased.

Imaging & Diagnostics:
The initial pre and post-contrast MRI of the entire spine showed extensive, mostly brightly enhancing intradural extramedullary nodules extending from C5–6 to T11. The multifocal spinal masses were suspicious for leptomeningeal carcinomatosis and imaging was ordered to look for a primary tumor source. An MRI of the brain showed no tumor although there was a small nonspecific non-enhancing extra-axial nodule in the left side prepontine cistern at the level of the upper pons. The patient’s computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed no tumor, and two CSF specimens were also negative for neoplastic cells. A follow-up MRI of the spine was performed ten days later to determine the patient’s response to steroid therapy and showed no significant change.

Patient Condition:
The patient did not have a history of neurofibromatosis or any other neurocutaneous disorders. The patient also did not have a past medical history of tumors, chemotherapy, or radiation. The patient does have a history of polio which she recalled contracting at about two years of age. The patient’s mother was diagnosed with a fast-growing brain tumor in her 80s, but otherwise, the patient’s family history was unremarkable. An initial laminectomy for partial excision of the tumor was done for tissue diagnosis, and once the lesion was determined to be a pilocytic astrocytoma, a decision was made to proceed with an extensive resection of the tumor.

Treatment Provided:
Routine hematoxylin and eosin–stained sections of the tumor samples showed multiple well-circumscribed masses made up predominantly of interlacing fascicles of spindle cells with thin wavy nuclei. Mitoses were elevated and nuclei were hyperchromatic, signifying the presence of anaplastic features. The patient was treated with radiation therapy with concurrent temozolomide chemotherapy to treat the residual tumor. The patient was treated with large field radiation to the spinal cord, receiving a total dose of 36 Gy in 20 fractions with daily dose concurrent temozolomide. Maintenance temozolomide was started, with a plan to treat the patient for six additional cycles.

Outcome and Follow-Up:
At the time of this writing, it has been 13 months since her symptoms first began and six months since her final surgery. The patient presented for a physician visit a month after the final surgical procedure. She was experiencing paresthesias in all four extremities, in addition to thoracic radicular type numbness bilaterally at T5. The patient was participating in physical therapy and had persistent bilateral lower extremity weakness. The patient will continue to follow up with her physicians to monitor her condition and adjust her treatment plan as necessary.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Date of Admission: [REDACTED]
Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

HOSPITAL COURSE

The patient was admitted to [REDACTED] due to hemoptysis, which was investigated to rule out various infectious causes such as pulmonary tuberculosis. The investigations all came back negative. However, the patient was later hospitalized twice for pneumonia while living abroad and likely accompanied by pulmonary hemorrhage due to first erosion of red blood cells. Because of this recurring hemoptysis, the patient then underwent a comprehensive work-up, including a lung biopsy that confirmed pulmonary hemosiderosis. Although the patient had no precedent of cow's milk allergy, milk avoidance and systemic corticosteroids were initiated.

During the patient's stay, he was monitored for any potential complications. He remained clinically stable throughout his hospital course and responded well to treatment. After the treatment, the patient eventually was discharged from the hospital.

Admitting Diagnosis: Asymptomatic gastric mass

Final Diagnosis: Gastric fundus splenosis with associated hemangioma

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 74-year-old woman with a history of schistosomiasis cirrhosis splenectomy at 29 years old, was admitted to the Gastroenterology Department of our hospital for an asymptomatic gastric mass. CT scans and upper gastrointestinal endoscopy were performed, and the diagnosis of a gastric GIST was confirmed. A multidisciplinary conference was held to discuss the patient's case, and she was considered for a GIST resection under gastroscopy.

During the procedure, the surface of the mucosal, submucosal, muscle layers, and tumor surface were diffusely oozing, and the effect of electrocoagulation and hemostasis was extremely poor. Endoscopic surgery was arrested due to the risk of difficulties in controlling intra-abdominal bleeding on the serosal side. A combination of laparoscopic-gastroscope double-mirror surgery was decided to preserve the stomach, but the tumor location was high and concealed, even under laparoscopic direct vision. Ultimately, a traditional surgical resection was performed, and the tumor was removed. The patient's vital signs were stable, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit and discharged on postoperative day 10.

Diagnostic Findings:

CT scans revealed pipe stem cirrhosis, a well-demarcated 4-cm solid mass confined to the gastric wall suggestive of a GIST, and a 1-cm low-density lesion with a clear outline in the mass. Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed a 3.95 × 2.82-cm slightly low-level echoic homogeneous mass derived from the muscularis propria and a 1 × 1-cm lower level echoic area with a clear boundary in the mass. On macroscopic examination, 3.9 × 2.8 × 2.4-cm dark red masses surrounded by a completely thin capsule were observed in the gastric fundus muscularis propria, along with an approximately 1 × 1-cm nodule appearing as a circumscribed, non-encapsulated, honeycomb-like, and red-purple nodule, which formed with dilated congested vascular space with bleeding.

Medical Management:

No medical management regimen to report.

Disposition and Condition at Discharge:

The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10 in stable condition. She was instructed to follow-up with her primary care provider and scheduled for future visits with her gastroenterologist and surgeon to monitor her condition.

Assessment and Plan:

The patient was diagnosed with gastric fundus splenosis with an associated hemangioma. She underwent a traditional surgical resection and was discharged in stable condition. Close follow-up with her care team was arranged to monitor her condition going forward.",,,0

Patient: 68-year-old male with rectal tumor

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of rectal tumor. A two-thirds circumferential type 2 tumor in the rectum was identified through colonoscopy. Biopsy showed well differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma and papillary adenocarcinoma. The patient's medical history included diabetes mellitus, but there was no significant family or social history. Laboratory evaluation showed elevated fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels. The patient's serum tumor markers level also increased. Moreover, enhanced CT and pelvic MRI revealed a pararectal lymph node swelling and thickening of the wall in the lower rectum.

Treatment:
The patient underwent preoperative radiation therapy for 5 weeks to improve the local control and survival rate. Effective tumor reduction was observed after the treatment, and serum tumor marker levels decreased to normal range. Following this, a low anterior resection with temporary diverting ileostomy was performed. The pathology report showed residual poorly differentiated, non-solid type adenocarcinoma, but there was no lymph node metastasis, and the tumor was classified as stage I. Immunohistochemical studies revealed positive results for AFP, SALL4, and GPC3. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin.

Course of Recovery:
The postoperative course was uneventful, and the patient's serum tumor marker levels continued to decrease. The patient did not develop any recurrence for 6 months after the operation. The patient was discharged in good condition.

Conclusion:
AFP-producing colorectal cancer is rare, and there are no confirmed treatment strategies. The approach to management is similar to that of conventional colorectal cancer treatment. Preoperative radiation therapy with capecitabine was effective in this patient, and chemotherapy was performed in consideration of high recurrence rate. Immunohistochemical studies revealed AFP production, and the tumor was diagnosed as AFP-producing adenocarcinoma. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin, and the patient did not develop any recurrence for 6 months after the operation.",,,0

Date of Admission: January 2017
Date of Discharge: March 2017

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted due to right chest pain and a 1.56 L loss in forced vital capacity (FVC) over the previous 3 years.

Hospital Course:
During the patient's hospitalization, anamnestic investigation, physical examination, chest X-ray (CXR), serological, autoimmune and microbiological tests, computed tomography (CT), echocardiography, and phrenic nerve stimulation were conducted to identify the underlying cause of the patient's condition. A total body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) with 18-FluoroDeoxyGlucose (18-FDG) was performed in March 2017 which revealed a low intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-FDG in the right pleura with increased concentration in the basal, middle and posterior pleural surface. A surgical lung biopsy (SLB) was carried out, identifying a non-specific fibrinous pleurisy.

Outcome:
The patient's condition continued to worsen, as PFTs performed 1 month later revealed a further important drop in FVC (2.5 L loss). Despite treatment with a prednisolone course (0.25 mg/kg daily), the patient developed shortness of breath on exertion and ultimately died two weeks later due to a cardiac ischemic attack. Autopsy excluded mesothelioma or other pleural neoplastic diseases, but reported the presence of diffuse fibrinous pleurisy with collagen deposition.

Summary:
The patient was admitted due to right chest pain and a 1.56 L loss in FVC over the previous 3 years. Comprehensive investigations were conducted, including physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Age: 61
Gender: Female
Admission Date: [Redacted]
Discharge Date: [Redacted]

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with generalized erythroderma with mild infiltration and whitish fine scales observed on the body. The initial skin symptoms had developed during childhood, leading to a chronic course with no sustained clearance. The patient had been under regular dermatological care for 28 years, during which phototherapy and oral acitretin (25 mg/day) therapy were not effective. Methotrexate therapy was also aborted due to serious side effects. Based on clinical and histological findings, the patient was diagnosed with atypical pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) phenotype. Since the patient had developed symptoms in early childhood turning into a chronic course with no sustained clearance, she was classified as a PRP type V patient. The patient was not aware of any family members affected by PRP; however, both her daughter and a grandchild had psoriasis and were also under regular dermatological care. CARD14 gene variants were detected, suggesting a contribution to the development of PRP by increasing the activity of the NFκB signaling pathway.

Investigations:
Immunofluorescent (IF) staining was performed on paraffin-embedded samples of the lesional and non-involved skin from the PRP patient and from healthy individuals. The IF staining of the NFκB p65 subunit demonstrated p65-positive nuclei (in 31.68% of epidermal cells) present in the suprabasal epidermis of the lesional PRP skin but not in the non-involved skin of the patient or healthy skin samples. The NFκB activity was significantly higher in the cultured keratinocytes of the PRP patient compared to healthy keratinocytes. IF staining of the NFκB p65 subunit was also performed on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from the PRP patient and healthy individuals. Staining was more intense in the PBMCs of the PRP patient compared to cells of healthy individuals.

Treatment and Follow-up:
Expression and secretion of NFκB-induced cytokines were determined. The keratinocytes of the PRP patient showed a tendency for higher basal mRNA expression and significantly higher secretion of interleukin (IL)-1α and IL-1β compared to healthy keratinocytes. PBMCs of the PRP patient showed significantly higher basal mRNA expression of IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, compared to healthy controls. LPS treatment significantly induced the mRNA expression of IL-1β and IL-8 compared to untreated control samples, while in the PRP PBMCs significant induction was observed upon LPS treatment for all examined cytokines. The unstimulated PRP PBMCs secreted IL-8, while the secretion of the other cytokines was detected only after LPS treatment. IL-1α, IL-1β, and TNF-α were secreted at significantly higher levels in PRP cells compared to the PBMCs of healthy controls.

Summary:
The patient was diagnosed with atypical PRP phenotype with CARD14 gene variants contributing to the development of PRP by increasing the activity of the NFκB signaling pathway. The patient demonstrated increased NFκB activity in various cell types. The keratinocytes of the patient showed the secretion of higher levels of interleukins compared to healthy keratinocytes.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:
A 35-year-old nulliparous African-American female presented with a history of five first and one second trimester recurrent pregnancy losses. In addition, she had a nine-year history of irregular heavy bleeding associated with dysmenorrhea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
The patient's past medical history was not significant.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient was scheduled for hysteroscopy and diagnostic laparoscopy. She also gave consent for possible open Strassmans metroplasty.

On hysteroscopy, a normal looking endometrium was visualized with a right-sided tubal ostia and a small tubal ostia on the left that did not appear to be patent. Laparoscopically, a bicornuate uterus was found with associated endometriosis at the vesicouterine fold. Open metroplasty was done. A copper intrauterine device was left in situ to separate the uterine walls and possibly reduce the chances of uterine synechiae. In addition, endometriotic deposits discovered at the vesico uterine fold were ablated.

The patient had an unremarkable follow-up after surgery with no complications reported. A HSG 6 months after surgery revealed unification of the uterine horns but both tubes were not delineated.

Patient was lost to follow-up but two years later she presented having conceived spontaneously and a TVS revealed a single intrauterine pregnancy at 13 weeks. Her antenatal workup was as highlighted in the medical record.

At 33 weeks, the patient presented with a history of lower abdominal pain worsening over the past few weeks and right-sided fundal tenderness pain score of seven out of ten on the pain assessment scale. The patient did not have any features suggestive of bowel obstruction and had a normal NST and an obstetric ultrasound that was done showed a single intrauterine pregnancy with normal biophysical profile and no features of placental abruption or slower uterine segment site dehiscence. The pain was significant enough to warrant an admission for which she subsequently received antenatal steroids for lung maturity and opioid analgesia for pain relief. However, the pain did not completely resolve and she underwent a cesarean delivery at 33 weeks and 5 days due to persistent lower abdominal pain. The outcome was a live male infant with a birth weight of 1950 grams and APGAR of 9, 10, 10. There was no evidence of uterine rupture although she had venous congestion and massive varicose veins bilaterally at the cornual areas. The previous metroplasty scar was intact.

The patient had a resolution of the abdominal pain postoperatively and had an unremarkable postoperative recovery. She was discharged on the fifth postoperative day.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted for surgical treatment options of intractable seizures after failed medical management efforts. The patient had a 20-year history of seizures with semiology typically presenting with a hot flash and other sensory auras with evolution into focal motor activity, predominately on the right. Workup for seizure etiology revealed a large midline lipoma, partial callosal agenesis, and an adjacent lesion in the left frontal lobe. The patient underwent neuronavigation-guided resection of the left frontal enhancing mass and partial frontal lobectomy utilizing intraoperative EEG, cortical mapping, and SSEP monitoring. Intraoperative samples were found to have Rosenthal fibers and focal calcification. Permanent pathologic evaluation revealed a lipoma and focal cortical dysplasia, Palmini Type IA, in the adjacent brain. Post-operative imaging showed a near-total resection of the peripherally enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe and cingulate gyrus. The patient had a moderate supplementary motor area syndrome including hemiparesis, delayed speech, and changes in effect after the procedure, which gradually resolved. The patient remained seizure-free three years post resection.

Length of Stay: [REDACTED] days

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the dermatology clinic with severe facial acne, rated grade 4 on the Investigator Global Assessment of Acne scale. The patient had been using topical retinoids for several months with no satisfactory results. The patient was started on 20mg isotretinoin, which was maintained for 6 months. The patient presented with mild chelitis and skin dryness, and complained of mild hair fall. Liver enzymes and lipid profile were within the normal range for both the initial laboratory works and the repeated tests done after one month and four months. The patient experienced total clearance of her acne. However, treatment was interrupted because they could not visit the clinic for several weeks.

Two months after stopping the isotretinoin treatment, the patient developed depigmented lesions reminiscent of acrofacial vitiligo. The pattern of the vitiligo persisted despite topical treatment with Antifungal agents, so the patient was prescribed Tacrolimus 0.1% cream, which led to mild improvement of some of the lesions after eight weeks  before recurrence. The patient, in favor of alternative medicine, opted to cease topical treatment and receive homeopathic treatment instead.

Medical History:
Patient had no history of vitiligo but did have a family history of diabetes, hypertension, and systemic lupus erythematosus. An auntie had died from renal complications of SLE.

Diagnosis:
Acne, severe facial, clearance achieved with isotretinoin
Acrofacial vitiligo with complaints of depigmented lesions

Treatment:
The patient was treated with 20 mg isotretinoin for six months, which led to complete clearance of her acne. The patient then received Antifungal and Tacrolimus 0.1% topical therapy for her vitiligo with mild improvement after eight weeks, but later stopped it in favor of homeopathic treatment.

Patient Name: [Blank]
Date of Admission: [Blank]
Date of Discharge: [Blank]
Reason for Admission: Mandibular pain and swelling
Primary Diagnosis: SAPHO syndrome

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 26-year-old woman, was admitted to our hospital due to worsening mandibular pain and swelling. She had previously undergone root canal therapy for periapical periodontitis in the right lower first molar. However, her symptoms persisted and progressed over a period of 4 months, prompting referral to our hospital. Upon examination, she exhibited swelling and tenderness in the right mandibular region, along with sclerotic changes and periosteal reaction. Blood tests were unremarkable, ruling out inflammation, and dental infection was ruled out as the cause of her symptoms. Scans confirmed active mandibular osteomyelitis/osteitis and revealed bilateral palatine tonsils and reactive lymphadenopathy. Considering the patient's clinical and radiological manifestations, SAPHO syndrome was diagnosed.

The patient had a history of palmoplantar pustulosis, which was treated locally at a dermatology clinic. Tonsillectomy and bone biopsy of the right mandible were performed. The biopsy showed enlarged and sclerotic bone trabeculae with little inflammatory cell infiltration, which was compatible with the diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome. The patient was administered salazosulfapyridine 1000 mg/day and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as required. Her pain resolved, and there were no signs of recurrence after a 5-month follow-up period.

Summary:
The patient had been diagnosed with SAPHO syndrome, a rare inflammatory disease that affects the skin, bones, and joints. She had been experiencing mandibular pain and swelling that were not associated with dental infection. The diagnosis was confirmed through imaging studies and bone biopsy. Treatment included salazosulfapyridine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient reported relief from her pain and did not experience any relapse after a 5-month follow-up.",,,0

Patient Information:
Name: [Redacted], Age: 5, Sex: Male, Admission Date: [Redacted], Discharge Date: [Redacted]

Chief Complaint and Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the hospital with language articulation disorders, uncoordinated movements, and repeated episodes of seizures that occurred frequently. The patient's stutter had no obvious causes and had existed for one and a half years. The patient had gradually developed unclear enunciation, clumsy speech, and slow responses over time. Within six months prior to admission, he began to have uncoordinated movements, such as ataxia and instable gait. Three episodes of generalized tonic-clonic seizures had occurred in the week just preceding the clinic visit, every episode lasting for about one minute and occurring about once every two days. The patient underwent various tests, including blood tests to check for lactic acid, homocysteine, ammonia, ceruloplasmin, and liver and kidney function, and cerebrospinal fluid and blood tests to analyze autoimmune encephalitis antibodies and genetic metabolic diseases. The tests did not reveal any significant abnormalities, and the EEG showed multiple spikes and slow-wave discharges bilaterally. Brain MRI scans showed high hyperintensities adjacent to the bilateral posterior horns of the lateral ventricles on T2-weighted images and broadened cerebellar fissures. The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy and treated with oral sodium valproate (VPA) at 15 mg/kg per day, which was subsequently increased to approximately 25 mg/kg per day in two weeks. VPA administration was maintained at a varied blood concentration range of 56–78 μg/mL over a period of six months. At the 6-month follow-up, the episodes had decreased from once every two days to about once a month, articulation disorders and uncoordinated movements persisted, and a visual test was performed, which showed no obvious abnormalities.

Medical History and Physical Examination:
The patient was a 5-year-old Chinese male who achieved appropriate developmental milestones before the age of 3.5 years and was born at full-term by vaginal delivery, without any complications. His parents had no known consanguinity, and both they and an older sister were healthy. On physical examination, the length, weight, and head circumference were normal for age, and the patient was conscious and showed normal muscle strength and muscle tone. Patellar reflex and Achilles tendon reflex were normal, and Babinski signs were negative. He was inarticulate and responded to questions slowly. He could not complete the hand-alternating movement test, heel–knee–tibia test, or finger-nose test due to poor cooperation with the instructions. The intelligence quotient value, measured by combined Raven's test, was at a medium level.

Diagnosis:
The patient was diagnosed with epilepsy due to the history of seizures and EEG results, as well as LINCL due to the genetic analysis showing a homozygous missense point mutation c.892G > A(p.Glu298Lys) in exon 7 in CLN6. The mutation was not detected in 259 control subjects. PolyPhen-2, SIFT, and MutationTaster analysis suggested that the mutation would negatively affect protein function.

Plan and Recommendations:
The patient was treated with oral sodium valproate (VPA) at a median level to reduce the frequency of seizures, which was considered successful over the course of six months. Articulation disorders and uncoordinated movements persisted, and no significant changes were observed in visual tests. The patient was discharged and recommended to maintain follow-up visits with a neurologist and geneticist to further monitor progression of LINCL.",,,0

Admission Date: [Admission Date]
Discharge Date: [Discharge Date]

History and Findings:
21-year-old female patient presented with a painless swelling on the right side of the mandible, growing slowly for the past year. Intraoral swelling was observed on clinical examination, extending from the posterior body of the mandible to the ramus on the right side. The lesion was hard in consistency and exhibited a softer texture in some areas. A well-defined radiolucent lesion extending from the interdental bone in between the second and third right molars to the ramus of the mandible was noted on CBCT scan, which showed expansion and thinning of the inner cortical plate.

Diagnosis:
Provisional diagnosis was an aggressive benign tumor, and CGCG, ameloblastoma, and KOT were considered in differential diagnosis. Fine, wispy septations and undulating borders observed in the lesion favored a central giant cell granuloma (CGCG) diagnosis. An incisional biopsy revealed a giant cell reparative granuloma formed of proliferating spindle cells, multinucleated giant cells, extravasated red blood cells, and mononuclear cells.

Treatment:
The patient underwent surgical resection of the lesion. The surgery and recovery were uneventful.

Laboratory Investigations:
Laboratory investigations showed parathyroid hormone, alkaline phosphatase, and calcium levels to be within normal limits, excluding hyperparathyroidism as a possible diagnosis.

Conclusion:
The patient was discharged after successful surgical excision of the lesion, and recovery was uneventful. Further follow-up is recommended to evaluate the patient's progress.

The 77-year-old female presented to the Emergency Room with oral lesions and jaw tightness, which led to her hospital admission. She received treatment with diazepam, cyclobenzaprine, nystatin, and chlorhexidine mouthwash and was given nutritional supplementation. After being discharged as an outpatient, she was readmitted with worsening symptoms. Her sodium level normalized, but she persisted with trismus and dysphagia. She was given an atypical antipsychotic and antidepressant for a presumptive diagnosis of depression with somatization symptoms. A lumbar puncture showed no bacterial growth. On the 14th day of illness, the patient developed right lid ptosis and ophthalmoparesis with a right gaze preference. Unfortunately, despite treatment, she developed episodes of agonal breathing and autonomic dysregulation characterized by bradycardia-tachycardia with labile blood pressure, which indicated possible progression to generalized tetanus. She had a cardiopulmonary arrest followed by myoclonus status epilepticus complicated with aspiration pneumonia and sepsis, which ultimately led to her death after 24 days of hospitalization.

Admitting Diagnosis: Altered bowel habit
Final Diagnosis: Low-grade tubulovillous adenoma

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to the surgical outpatient department for evaluation of altered bowel habit. Abdominal examination and digital rectal examination in the outpatient clinic were unremarkable. Colonoscopy study identified four abnormal lesions, two of which were colonic subcentimetre polyps. More distally in the mid-rectum, a villous polypoidal lesion was found, which was later biopsy-proven to be a low-grade tubulovillous adenoma (TVA). More proximally, a malignant-looking lesion associated with a stricture was detected in the distal sigmoid colon at 25 cm; however, biopsy samples from this region showed no evidence of malignancy. A staging computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrated a 7 cm segment of circumferential thickening at the site of the presumed sigmoid colon malignancy, associated with a few locoregional and inferior mesenteric lymph nodes. The proposed CT staging was T2/3 N1 M0. A surgical procedure, laparoscopic-assisted anterior resection, was planned for the patient to remove both the TVA and presumed sigmoid colon malignancy. Post-surgical histology confirmed that the rectal polyp was a low-grade TVA. However, histological assessment of the presumed sigmoid colon cancer demonstrated mucosal ulceration with underlying fibrosis and diverticulosis. The ulceration was associated with a 5 cm jagged edged intraluminal dental plate containing a single front upper incisor prosthetic tooth found impacted at this site, with no metallic components. No malignancy was demonstrated in the post-surgical specimen. The patient had a good post-surgical recovery and went on to have an uncomplicated reversal of defunctioning colostomy several months later.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted with complaints of headache, blurring of vision, dysarthria, and acute left-side hemiplegia and right-sided ptosis. The previous hospital diagnosed the patient with a brain abscess.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission to our hospital, the patient underwent an MRI with intravenous contrast, which revealed a ring enhancement lesion in the right basal ganglia. Brain biopsy was performed, and the pathology slides showed the presence of T. gondii tachyzoite, considered indicative of TE reactivation. Anti Toxoplasma IgG was positive in lab data, and the HIV antibody test was positive by ELISA method, which was confirmed by the Western blot method. The patient's husband was an addict and had passed away a few years ago. The patient underwent six weeks of treatment with pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, folinic acid, and dexamethasone to treat the toxoplasmosis, which led to a significant decrease in Anti Toxoplasma IgG. Triple therapy with Anti-HIV drugs (Tenofovir, emtricitabine, and efavirenz) was also performed. The patient's condition improved, and the ring enhancement lesion was eliminated on imaging of the brain.

Discharge Condition:
The patient was discharged from the hospital in a relatively good condition.

Follow-up:
The patient will require continued treatment and monitoring to manage her HIV infection and prevent TE reactivation. Further imaging of the brain may also be necessary to ensure the elimination of the ring enhancement lesion.

Hospital Course:
The patient presented with urinary diversion through bilateral percutaneous nephrostomies after undergoing laparoscopic surgery for removal of a prostatic utricle cyst, which resulted in anuria. The patient had a history of lower abdominal pain and burning micturition on and off for two years. Following surgical treatment, the patient remained asymptomatic for about 18 months. A recurrence of symptoms was associated with an increase in cyst size. 

Diagnostic Tests and Procedures:
The patient underwent an ascending and micturating cysto-urethrogram which showed a smooth walled bladder with mildly reduced capacity and normal urethra. Urethrocystoscopy showed normal anterior urethra with an opening on verumontanum accommodating a 17-French cystoscope sheath with a smooth walled cavity containing about 200 mL of turbid fluid. MRI pelvis was conducted which revealed the absence of urinary bladder. Bilateral lower ureteric injury was initially suspected as nephrostomogram showed complete cut-off of both lower ureters. 

Treatment Plan and Outcome:
Surgery was discontinued due to the realization of accidental urinary bladder cystectomy instead of prostatic utricular cystectomy. The patient opted for orthotopic neo-bladder, where the prostatic utricle cyst was marsupialized, and its opening into the urethra was closed. Studer's orthotopic ileal neobladder was constructed, and nephrostomies were clamped and removed after postoperative MCU showed good capacity neobladder and no extravasation. At follow-up, the patient was voiding well with minimal residue and no incontinence. The outcomes in terms of ejaculation were yet unknown.

Spectroscopy studies suggest a lack of maturity of the frontal lobe, parietal areas, and basal nuclei, while EEG studies reflect the presence of abnormal activity with generalized slow pattern and theta and delta bursts bilaterally in temporal regions, both in sleep and awake states. After diagnosis, the patient was treated with valproic acid and showed an adequate response both physiologically and clinically.

Discharge summary:
The patient, a 2.3 year-old boy of South American ethnic background, was discharged with a diagnosis of microcephalus, complex febrile seizures, and moderate developmental delay. He was treated with valproic acid during his hospital stay and responded positively. His MRIs showed hyperintense lesions in both corona radiata regions, more evident in the right side. Additionally, spectroscopy studies suggested a lack of maturity of the frontal lobe, parietal areas, and basal nuclei, and EEG studies showed abnormal activity with generalized slow pattern and theta and delta bursts bilaterally in temporal regions, during both sleep and awake states.

Previous medical history revealed prenatal exposure to ethanol, which could have contributed to the onset of his current symptoms. Genetic testing confirmed abnormalities in the transcription of the EN2 gene, with the deletion of 183 bases (2475–2657 bases, C7 marker).

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted to the Pediatric Orthopedic Clinic, Imam Khomeini Hospital, Tehran, Iran on July 2018 with the diagnosis of Cockayne syndrome.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient presented with severe developmental delays and cognitive impairments, including the inability to walk or stand. Physical examination revealed flexion contractures in elbows, wrists, knees, and hips. Additionally, the patient displayed bilateral equinovarus deformity of feet and increased popliteal angle. Plantar reflexes showed extension response and DTRs were exaggerated. Spastic response of muscles was recorded after continuous stretching. Sitting balance was extremely unstable. 

Medical History:
The patient was born as the only child of otherwise healthy parents and was the result of a consanguine marriage. He had a normal pregnancy and a birth weight of 2950 grams. In the few first months of his life, he showed normal weight gain and development. However, the pediatrician noticed a decreased head circumference growth at 5 months age during a routine screening. Further investigation showed that the head circumference reached a plateau in its growth around 12 months age. Since then, the patient's general and developmental condition seemed to experience a sudden pause with progressive delay in growth and development. He lost his ability to rolling over and never gained any gross motor milestones. His face became expressionless and his eyes started to sink into the orbits. 

Diagnosis:
Although the physical examination had similarities to a patient with cerebral palsy, the patient's history was inconsistent with the diagnosis of CP in almost all aspects. After a thorough history-taking and further investigation, the diagnosis of Cockayne syndrome was established. The patient was homozygous for ECCR6 gene (genotype: c.2551 T>A /p.W851R- c.2551 T>A /p.W851R), and the parents were heterozygous for the same gene.

Outcome:
The patient was discharged with recommendations for continued occupational therapy to improve his quality of life. Additionally, his family was advised to provide support and comfort to the patient, as there is no cure for the condition.

Follow-up:
The patient's family was given a referral to a genetic counselor for genetic testing and counseling. Furthermore, the family was instructed to follow up with the pediatrician to monitor the patient's growth and development as well as the progression of the condition.

Patient: 69-year-old male

Admission date: [date]

Discharge date: [date]

Hospital course:

The patient was referred to the Medical Imaging Department for a virtual colonoscopy after a positive fecal occult blood test. The patient had mild chronic diarrhea that worsened due to metformin. The initial rectoscopy was normal, but the sigmoidoscopy was stopped due to pain caused by a spastic diverticular sigmoid. As the patient was taking clopidrogel (Plavix) for ischemic heart disease, a total optical colonoscopy was not conducted due to a relative contraindication. During the automated low-pressure colonic insufflation with carbon dioxide, the insufflator stopped repeatedly, indicating a colonic stenosis or obstacle. A complete cut-off of the inflated colon was observed on a CT topogram at the level of the sigmoid and descending colonic junction.

Diagnostic findings:

A short contrast-enhancing “scar-like” intra- and extraparietal structure was seen infiltrating the posterior colonic wall at the level of the sigmoid and descending colonic junction. This curvilinear retractile “scar-like” tissue had developed multiple adherences with the retroperitoneum and the left iliac fossa and seemed to be stapling the colon on the retroperitoneum. Ultrasound study showed a thickening of the muscle layer at the junction of the sigmoid and descending colon, demonstrating a centripetal retractile convergence of the muscle layers to an intraparietal very hyperechoic and very attenuating scar. Classical colonic opacification on the next day confirmed a complete retrograde and unidirectional stenosis. Gross anatomy of the resected colonic segment confirmed a short stricture constituted by corbelling fibrosis infiltrating the colonic wall of a diverticular segment. Histology showed typical fibrosis with discrete chronic inflammatory infiltrates and lymphoid clusters. Few microabscesses related to chronic diverticulitis were also found.

Treatment:

After a discussion with the multidisciplinary staff, a celioscopic resection of the stenotic segment was proposed to protect the patient from prograde occlusion. The celioscopic resection was difficult due to retroperitoneal and left ureteral adherences, so a classical laparotomy became necessary. The postoperative period was uneventful. Four months later, the patient underwent a ceolioscopic right hemicolectomy for a small adenocarcinoma of the caecum that was not visible on the CT.

Follow-up:

The patient was discharged on [date]. The multidisciplinary staff recommended the patient for follow-up with the gastroenterologic staff to complete the study of the proximal colon which had not been studied. The patient was advised to discontinue clopidrogel (Plavix). A comprehensive medical evaluation was recommended with the gastroenterologist.

Admitting Diagnosis: Sclerosing Lymphocytic Lobulitis

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 27-year-old woman, was admitted to our hospital for further investigation upon referral from another hospital where a routine check-up showed changes in the right breast. The patient had a history of left breast cancer diagnosed at the age of 22 and had undergone wide excision, sentinel node procedure, adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormonal therapy. A follow-up examination, coinciding with the conclusion of hormonal therapy, showed a multifocal nodular contrast enhancement in the retro-areolar region and the lower-outer quadrant of the right breast. The patient's examination was categorized as BIRADS 4, and follow-up included breast ultrasound every six months and a yearly mammogram and MRI of the breasts.

An ultrasound-assisted core biopsy was performed, which revealed dense lymphocytic infiltrate of predominantly B-lymphocytes surrounding the ductulolobular unit and the vessels, in combination with a fibrous stroma of low cellularity and an increase in fibroblasts. This led to a diagnosis of sclerosing lymphocytic lobulitis, with no signs of malignancy detected. 

The patient's hypoechoic lesion on ultrasonography and the multifocal contrast enhancement on MRI gradually diminished over consecutive examinations to a level where it is barely perceptible. The patient was advised to continue regular follow-up examinations.

The patient was discharged on MM/DD/YYYY in stable condition with instructions to continue follow-up examinations as scheduled. Discharge medications included [ OMITTED ]. The patient was advised to follow a healthy lifestyle, which includes regular exercise and a balanced diet, and to report any abnormal symptoms to her healthcare provider.

A 64-year-old female with Stage 1B pancreatic adenocarcinoma came in complaining of dizziness and hypotension after receiving neoadjuvant gemcitabine chemotherapy and radiation and undergoing a Whipple procedure at another institution. 

Hospital Course Summary:
A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen was performed, showing an incidental solid enhancing mass measuring 2.5cm in the left kidney's lower pole. This mass was initially suspicious for renal cell carcinoma, but comparing it to pre-treatment imaging performed nine months earlier, the mass corresponded to a 3.0cm lesion that demonstrated regions of negative attenuation, characteristic of angiomyolipoma (AML).

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to our clinic for refractive surgery due to complex myopic astigmatism. Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) surgery was planned after astigmatic keratotomy. During the bilateral astigmatic keratotomy procedure, there was an accidental infusion of distilled water instead of BSS into the anterior chambers of both eyes. Immediate irrigation with BSS was carried out. 

Postoperatively, the patient developed dense superficial punctate keratitis in both eyes, which was treated with topical 1% prednisolone acetate and 5% NaCl eye drops. There were no intraocular pressure changes noted. Corneal edema and anterior chamber reactions persisted despite treatment, and thin vacuolar anterior subcapsular opacity was observed in the right eye. The patient's vision was blurry, and mild pain was experienced in both eyes. 

One week after surgery, there was partial recognition of the clear lens in the nondilated state, and anterior subcapsular cataract decreased in a centripetal pattern. Two weeks after surgery, corneal edema decreased slightly with altered anterior chamber reactions, and the cataract became smaller, exhibiting a moth-eaten appearance. One month after surgery, the corneal and anterior chambers cleared in both eyes, the cataract diminished in size, and a starry appearance was observed. So, SMILE surgery was performed at 2 months after the astigmatic keratotomy. There were no surgical complications noted during the 3-month postoperative follow-up, and the subcapsular cataract of the right eye became fainter. 

Outcome:
At the time of discharge, the patient had a UDVA of 20/300 and a BCDVA of 20/20 in both eyes with a stable refraction. Corneal endothelial cell densities were 1852 mm2 in the right eye and 2762 mm2 in the left eye.

The patient was admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) after being involved in a road accident that resulted in open fractures of the right femur and tibia. At the time of admission, the patient was conscious and hemodynamically stable. An initial alignment of the fractured ends was performed, and a total body CT showed no other injuries.

The patient was taken to the operating room for external fixation of the fractured bones. The procedure was performed under general anesthesia, and monitoring was initiated to assess the patient's vital signs. The procedure lasted for three hours, after which the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with intubation and mechanical ventilation. The iv anaesthetics were gradually tapered.

Two hours later, the patient's respiratory and neurological status deteriorated. An urgent CT scan of the head showed a diffuse cerebral edema and the herniation of the cerebellar tonsils. Repeated boluses of iv. mannitol and steroids were given in the following hours to reduce the intracranial pressure. An echocardiogram revealed a severe right ventricular depression with an ejection fraction of 20%.

On the following day, the patient's neurological status worsened, and the patient was declared brain dead according to current Italian law.

At the autopsy, the cerebral microvascular network appeared diffusely plugged with BME, and ischemia-related microcalcifications were scattered throughout the brain. Other organs were less extensively involved, and no PFO was demonstrated.

Hospital Course:

The patient was a 70-year-old man who presented with repeated upper abdominal pain and was diagnosed with resectable pancreatic cancer of the pancreatic body. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) suggested that the patient may have a stricture of the CA root, which may have been caused by median arcuate ligament (MAL). Pancreaticoduodenectomy with division of the MAL was scheduled but unexpected bleeding around the CA was observed during surgery. Bleeding could be controlled by simple compression only, and hemostasis by suturing was attempted first. Contrary to expectations, the bleeding intensified, making it difficult to confirm the bleeding point. Therefore, supraceliac aortic cross-clamping (SAC) was performed to manage the bleeding. After performing SAC, the bleeding intensity significantly decreased, and a defect of the adventitia measuring 7 mm in diameter on the CA was confirmed. The defect was repaired, and the patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy to decrease the risk of hepatic infarction. The patient was discharged uneventfully on postoperative day 19.

Admitting Diagnosis: Abdominal wall tumor
Principal Diagnosis: Foreign-body granuloma
Secondary Diagnosis: Elevated inflammatory markers

Hospital Course:
A 57-year-old Japanese man was admitted to the hospital with increasing right lower abdominal pain. On initial examination, an abdominal wall tumor was detected using transabdominal ultrasound. Laboratory results revealed elevated inflammatory markers. Helical computed tomography (CT) revealed a solid mass and magnetic resonance imaging showed a mass that exhibited low intensity. Positron emission tomography–CT revealed fluorodeoxyglucose accumulation.

The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and a malignant tumor was suspected. Intraoperative findings at laparotomy revealed an elastic, hard, milky-whitish mass with a rough surface and capillary growth in the right lower quadrant. The mass was completely removed, and the surgical margin secured. Pathologic examination revealed that these masses were foreign-body granulomas consisting of string-like crystals and a foreign-body giant cell. Immunohistological staining was positive in cells surrounding phosphoglyceride crystals. The patient underwent regular follow-up abdominal ultrasound examination and CT postoperatively. As of 3 years after the procedure, no signs of recurrence have been detected.

Discussion:
PGDD is a rare disease characterized by deposition of phosphoglyceride crystals. It can sometimes form a large mass and be misdiagnosed as a malignant tumor. Little is known about its etiology and pathogenesis. This deposition disease is apparently triggered by injury and subsequent macrophage aggregation, with a histological picture of deposited crystal radiating from the cell membranes of epithelioid cells. No specific markers exist for PGDD, and differentiating this disease from malignant tumors without pathological examination is difficult.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, a foreign-body granuloma was discovered during the patient's exploratory laparotomy. The mass was completely removed, and the surgical margin secured. Regular follow-up has not revealed any findings suspicious of recurrence.",,,0

Admitting Diagnosis: Pyeloplasty for right pelviureteric junction obstruction

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient presented with fever with chills, burning micturition and right flank pain with a high white blood cell count of 32 cells/hpf and 1 bacteria/hpf, which led to suspicion of post-pyeloplasty stricture as the cause of these symptoms. CT imaging was performed, which showed perinephric fat stranding and hydronephrosis with sudden tapering of the right ureter at the pelviureteric junction. However, due to the patient's high creatinine level, the administration of iodinated contrast was not feasible. Therefore, MRI was performed to diagnose the cause of obstruction, which showed hydronephrosis of the right kidney with sudden tapering at the level of the pelviureteric junction with diffusion restriction at the tip of the renal pyramid, with widening of the fornices, clubbing of the calyces and filling defects in the lower pole and interpolar calyx. Additionally, cleft was noted at the lower pole. These imaging findings suggested the presence of a right pelviureteric junction stricture with papillary necrosis. There was also growth of Candida species on fungal cultures.

The patient was started on broad-spectrum antibiotics with systemic antifungals, leading to resolution of fever and flank pain and normalization of the urinary white blood cell count. Post-treatment urine culture was normal.

The patient was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with their primary care physician for further management of their chronic kidney disease and diabetes. They were advised to maintain a healthy lifestyle, manage their blood sugar levels, and follow up as instructed by their healthcare provider.

The initial physical exam was unremarkable, and laboratory tests were only remarkable for increased lactate dehydrogenase and borderline-low albumin. The chest radiograph showed moderate left and small right pleural effusions with a left retrocardiac opacity. Computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was performed and was negative for pulmonary embolism and showed only small bilateral pleural effusions. Thoracentesis was performed, and approximately 1L of brown fluid from the left pleural space was removed. Pleural fluid evaluation demonstrated an exudative effusion with elevated levels of lipase and amylase. CT abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a fluid density tract arising from the pancreatic tail, communicating with the left pleural space. The patient was started on medical therapy with octreotide. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) confirmed a pancreaticopleural fistula with irregular, dilated, main pancreatic and common bile ducts. 

ERCP was performed which redemonstrated pancreatic duct leak in the most upstream tail of the pancreas that extended caudally to the left pleural cavity, consistent with pancreaticopleural fistula. After the procedure, the patient developed acute pancreatitis, which was managed with bowel rest and empiric antibiotics. The hospital course was further complicated by the development of Klebsiella and enterococcus faecalis infections. 

The patient improved clinically with medical management, and a repeat ERCP 9 weeks after the procedure showed no extravasation of contrast from the pancreatic tail. The pancreatic duct stent was downsized to 5Fr. Repeat ERCP 15 weeks after the index procedure showed no extravasation of contrast or stenosis, and the pancreatic duct stent was removed.

Hospital Course: The patient was admitted with complaints of dyspnea and cough. She had previously undergone permanent pacemaker implantation for idiopathic third-degree atrioventricular block and was recently diagnosed with pericarditis secondary to pacemaker insertion. On admission, the patient was found to have a small amount of pericardial effusion. During her hospitalization, the pericardial effusion persisted, and she developed dyspnea, dry cough, and fever. A chest X-ray showed a round opacity with smooth borders in the midright lung field, which was a major change compared to prior films. Blood tests were remarkable for elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and high white blood cell count. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a thickened pericardium with pericardial effusion and a thick-walled pericardial cystic mass adjacent to the tip of atrial pacemaker lead, suspected to be extracardiac.

The patient underwent surgery and a large cystic mass was completely excised, carefully preserving the right phrenic nerve.

On day of life (DOL) 2, he was transferred to our hospital for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), supraventricular tachycardia, persistent hypoglycemia, and hypoplastic aortic arch.

Diagnostic Assessment and Treatment:
During the hospital stay, the patient's glucose infusion rate (GIR) was gradually increased to 16 mg/kg/min to maintain plasma glucose close to 70 mg/dL when titrating IV dextrose. Despite consuming 26 cal/oz. of formula, he developed hypoglycemic episodes (BG below 50mg/dL) on DOL 21. A workup for Congenital Hyperinsulinism (CHI) was initiated on DOL 25. The results revealed an elevated insulin level of 16.3 mcIU/mL coincident with a plasma glucose level of 48 mg/dL and beta hydroxybutyrate level of less than 100 mcmol/L. The patient's ammonia, pyruvic acid, cortisol level, serum amino acids, acyl carnitine profile, and urine organic acids were all normal. A DNA sequencing test for CHI revealed a heterozygous maternally-inherited likely pathogenic variant in KCNJ11, c.616C > T (p.Arg206Cys).

Reason for Hospitalization:
The 72-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital with pancreatic head and neck carcinoma for evaluation and surgical operation. She had several symptoms, including abdominal pain, icterus, and generalized itching.

Hospital Course:
The patient underwent several imaging procedures, including abdominal computed tomography, endosonographic imaging, and diagnostic ampullary biopsy, to evaluate her condition. The results revealed that the patient had a hypodense mass in the head and neck of the pancreas, periampullary lesions, and a slightly dilated main pancreatic duct in the body of the pancreas.

During the Whipple procedure, it was found that the tumor had spread, and total pancreatectomy was performed. Postoperative pathological studies revealed that the tumor extended to the duodenum and invaded the venous, lymphatic vessels, and perineural sites, although no distant metastasis was found. The patient was diagnosed with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS).

Treatment:
The patient was started on insulin and Creon after surgery to maintain long-term health. Contrast-enhanced thoracic high-resolution CT scans and multidetector CT scans of abdominopelvic were conducted at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months after the operation to evaluate metastasis occurrence, but no evidence of metastasis was detected.

Follow-Up:
The patient was disease-free during the 5-year follow-up period and tolerated total pancreatectomy well. Further follow-up investigations were done regularly by periodic CT scan and ultrasonic imaging.

Diagnosis:
Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS), pathologic stage II A.

Conclusion:
The patient was referred to our hospital with pancreatic head and neck carcinoma and underwent total pancreatectomy for undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (UPS). The patient was started on insulin and Creon after surgery and was disease-free during the 5-year follow-up period. Further follow-up investigations were conducted regularly to ensure the patient's long-term health.",,,0

Hospital Course:
This is a discharge summary for a 63-year-old male patient who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) due to pancreatic head cancer. The patient underwent two courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine (GEM) and S-1 for 6 months preoperatively based on the protocol of clinical research (Japan Adjuvant Study Group of Pancreatic Cancer 04 study). Histopathologically, the tumor was diagnosed as poorly differentiated, tubular adenocarcinoma, with pT2, N0, pStage IB according to the UICC classification, seventh edition. After the surgery, he received adjuvant S-1 therapy.

Three months after the PD, blood tests showed coagulation derangements with high C-reactive protein (CRP 11.30 mg/dl). Computed tomography scan (CT) revealed a 55-mm mass alongside the transverse colon. During 2 weeks of follow-up, the coagulation derangement and elevated CRP (17.66 mg/dl) persisted. Repeat CT showed that the tumor enlarged to 65 mm, and an additional mass, 25 mm in diameter, was detected in the jejunum. He was hospitalized due to abdominal pain and diarrhea with persistent high fever and was inspected; however, there was no evidence for infections.

The patient underwent an emergency surgical intervention for large and small bowel metastasis from resected pancreatic cancer. Extirpation of the tumors combined with partial resection of the transverse colon and the jejunum was performed on the eighth day of hospitalization. Immediately after the emergency surgery, the fever resolved and the CRP level normalized. He was discharged and received nab-paclitaxel with GEM chemotherapy for 2 months postoperatively. The patient selected for best supportive care after this. The patient died due to a relapse with mesenteric lymph node metastasis 7 months after the emergency surgery (13 months after the first surgery).

In conclusion, the emergency surgical intervention was successful in providing relief from the symptoms caused by the underlying malignancy, and the patient was able to return home. While there were few reports about metachronous intestinal metastases after PC surgery, in oncological emergencies, surgical intervention is expected to improve patient’s quality of life. Based on the advancement of multimodality treatments, such as chemotherapy, in the recent years, even metastatic lesions from PC would turn to be resectable in some cases. Therefore, surgical resection should be considered for large and small bowel metastasis from resected PC in selected patients.",,,0

Hospital Course:
A 45-year-old Japanese woman was admitted to our hospital with swelling and bone exposure of the left buccal region. She had previously undergone excisional biopsy twice, which led to the same diagnosis of osteoma. Computed tomography (CT) showed a diffuse radiopaque lesion around the maxillary alveolar cortical bone surface spanning from the first molar to the second molar. Biopsy demonstrated features of necrotic bone without atypia. The exposed region recovered after the biopsy without any additional treatment. However, bone exposure was noticed again in the same region after a year and the swelling enlarged over time. Two debulking surgeries including biopsy were performed in the following years, but these biopsies did not demonstrate features of malignancy. CT showed a diffuse bone mass accompanied by radiolucent areas, which arose from the surface of maxillary alveolar bone and invaded into the pterygopalatine fossa. Histopathological assessment showed a stromal component consisting of dense atypical spindle cell proliferation and focal cartilage formation with mild atypia. Immunohistochemical staining showed diffuse expression of β-catenin and α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in atypical spindle cells. These cells were also stained by runt-related gene 2 (RUNX-2), special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2 (SATB2), or sex-determining region Y-box 9 (SOX9), indicating that these cells were derived from cells that had the ability to differentiate into osteoblastic cells and cartilage cells. Moreover, co-expression of murine double minute 2 (MDM2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) along with a dedifferentiated subtype of high-grade sarcoma was seen. She was diagnosed with stage IIB dedifferentiated parosteal osteosarcoma (DPOS) based on the Enneking staging system.

The condition was treated by wide resection and chemotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) was performed consisting of pirarubicin (THP-ADM) and ifosfamide (IFO). Although slight shrinking of the tumor was observed in radiological examination after three cycles of chemotherapy, the majority of the tumor did not demonstrate any other changes. Subsequently, subtotal maxillectomy was performed using a combined transcranial approach with orbitozygomatic osteotomy and transcervical approach with mandibulectomy. The surgical specimen was examined histopathologically. Although a decrease in cell density and tumor degeneration due to NAC were observed in the high-grade component, the number of tumor cells in the low-grade component remained viable. Therefore, the chemotherapy effect was considered to be grade 1 based on the Huvos grading system. Based on the recommendation of adjuvant chemotherapy in DPOS treatment, additional chemotherapy using cisplatin (CDDP) + THP-ADM was administered. The post-treatment progress was good, and no severe functional morbidity, such as eating dysfunction or dysphonia, was observed. Her General Oral Health Assessment Indices (GOHAI) were 59 and 53 points before operation and a year after surgery, respectively. She has shown no indication of recurrence after 15 months.

Patient Identification: 73-year-old Japanese female with a history of diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol

Hospital Course:
The patient was referred to our clinic to further examine a solid tumor found in the main pancreatic duct of the pancreatic body. After undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy and D2 lymph node dissection, the patient was diagnosed with stage I ductal adenocarcinoma. The surgical margin was tumor-free, and no lymph nodes or distant metastases were found. The patient underwent six courses of S-1 as postoperative adjuvant therapy and has undergone medical check-ups every month, including tumor marker checks. The patient has not shown any evidence of recurrence so far after 29 months.

Summary of Findings:
The patient's medical history includes a family history of gastric and pancreatic cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient was found to have a cystic lesion in the pancreas which periodically checked for seven years until it was radiologically suspected of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). After a dull feeling in the stomach and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis, dynamic computed tomography and endoscopic ultrasonography showed no cyst, but a solid tumor in the main pancreatic duct of the pancreatic body. Pathology results found a circumscribed nodular tumor in the pancreatic main duct, which immunohistochemical analysis confirmed as MCP, with no evidence of cysts or IPMNs.

Impression:
The patient has a history of multiple comorbidities, including diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. The patient underwent surgical intervention of stage I MCP after nine years of watchful waiting, followed by adjuvant therapy. The patient has not shown any evidence of recurrence so far after 29 months. MCP has a better prognosis compared to usual ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas, but 70% of patients die of the disease, 11 within a year of diagnosis. MCP has two possible genetic pathways: KRAS mutation and microsatellite instability (MSI). The patient's case showed a KRAS codon 12 mutation (G12V) and microsatellite stability. MCP potentially consists of more than one subtype, and detailed molecular characterization using larger numbers of MCP cases should be conducted in future studies.",,,0

Date of Discharge: [REDACTED]

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted to the Respiratory Disease Unit at the University Hospital for a 6-month exertional dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusion that was prevalent on the right side, detected on chest computed tomography (CT). The patient underwent a series of procedures, including thoracic ultrasound, medical thoracoscopy, and surgical pleural biopsy, to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

Hospital Course:
The patient had a complex hospital course, with multiple diagnostic tests and procedures performed during the hospital stay. Initially, a repeated CT scan was conducted, which ruled out a pulmonary embolism but confirmed moderate right pleural effusion with parietal and visceral pleural thickening, in the absence of significant parenchymal abnormalities. Subsequent thoracentesis was performed, and the fluid was consistent with exudate. However, the microbiological tests, including an acid-alcohol-fast bacilli (AAFB) search, were negative. The patient subsequently underwent a medical thoracoscopy, which revealed a large lymphoplasmacytic infiltration, fibrosis, reactive mesothelial cells, and vascular proliferation, suggestive for non-specific pleuritis (NSP). The patient was treated with steroids and showed clinical and radiological improvement.

Six months later, the patient complained of chest discomfort and mild dyspnea, and a relapse of a small amount of right pleural effusion associated with diffuse pleural thickening was detected through a CT scan. The patient was referred to the Thoracic Surgery Unit of Sant’ Andrea University Hospital (Rome) for a surgical pleural biopsy, which revealed a diffuse fibrosing pleuritis, with hyaline features, fibrinous exudate, and a dense lymphocytic and plasma cell inflammation. Immunoperoxidase stains showed a marked increase of IgG4 positive plasma cells, with high IgG4 serum levels. Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with IgG4-related pleuritis. Steroid therapy was promptly initiated, with complete resolution of pleural effusion, improved respiratory symptoms, and the progressive reduction of IgG4 serum levels.

Diagnosis and Condition:
The final diagnosis was IgG4-related pleuritis. The patient's condition improved with steroid therapy, and the discharge was approved.

Discharge Plan:
The patient is advised to continue taking the prescribed medication and to follow-up with their physician as per schedule. Detailed instructions on the dosages, side-effects, and warnings of the prescribed medication are given to the patient along with instructions on when to schedule follow-up appointments.

Summary:
The admission to the Respiratory Disease Unit at the University Hospital was due to a 6-month exertional dyspnea and bilateral pleural effusion prevalent on the right side.

His symptoms worsened over time, and he presented eighteen days later at our facility with severe vision loss in his right eye. He reported a history of heavy drinking, chronic peptic discomfort, and weight loss caused by loss of appetite after abstinence from alcohol. 

During the course of his hospitalization, he was diagnosed with dm2 and treated with Metformin. Blood and serologic tests were done to identify the underlying cause of the patient's eye condition. A presumptive diagnosis of right endophthalmitis was made, and vitreous and anterior chamber taps of the right eye were performed to determine the causative organism. 

The patient underwent an extensive surgical procedure in which pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) was performed, along with phacoemulsification to remove a white elevated fluffy mass with overlying retinal whitening and necrosis in the superior periphery. Careful clearance of the white fluffy mass in superior and peripheral vitreous was achieved without retinal break formation. 

Postoperatively, the patient received topical levofloxacin 0.5% and prednisolone 1% acetate eye drops six times a day, along with atropine 1% ointment at night for the right eye. Results of vitreous samples PCR were positive for Klebsiella pneumonia (KP), confirming the diagnosis of EE caused by KP. An intravitreal injection of ceftazidime 2 mg/0.1 ml on the right eye was performed, and the patient was discharged for follow-up as an outpatient with levofloxacin 0.5% and prednisolone 1% acetate eye drops administered topically for one week.

Admitting Diagnosis: Liver Metastases from Gastric Cancer

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient's medical history revealed that he had undergone laparoscopic total gastrectomy with D1+ regional lymph node dissection 30 months prior for early gastric cancer. The patient underwent open splenectomy, after which histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of solid-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma originating from the previous gastric cancer.
The patient was treated with chemotherapy using S-1 plus oxaliplatin initially, but abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple liver metastases four months after splenectomy. Ramucirumab plus paclitaxel was administered as the second-line treatment. After two courses of systemic treatment, abdominal contrast-enhanced CT revealed progression of liver metastases. The patient's laboratory results, including serum carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19-9, were within normal limits. The Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) and peripheral neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) were normal, while slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels were observed.
As the third-line treatment, the patient was administered 3 mg/kg, I.V., nivolumab every two weeks. The response to the treatment was assessed using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), which showed a marked shrinkage of liver metastases. After 12 cycles, abdominal CT revealed that all target lesions had disappeared, thus achieving complete clinical response.
The patient did not experience any adverse reactions during the course of the treatment. Currently, the patient continues to receive nivolumab treatment, and there is no evidence of disease recurrence for an 8-month period.

Patient: 53-year-old male with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis

Hospital course:
The patient was admitted with severe generalized muscle weakness and myalgias. He had been diagnosed with Grade 2 esophageal varices, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy in 2016. The patient was afebrile, tachycardic, and mildly hypertensive on presentation. Physical examination was remarkable for symmetrical proximal muscle tenderness and weakness. Laboratory findings showed elevations in creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), white blood cells (WBC), and creatine kinase (CK).
The etiology of patient’s rhabdomyolysis was unclear, but infectious, autoimmune, and malignant causes were investigated and excluded. The patient was aggressively treated with intravenous fluid resuscitation, and his myoglobinuria resolved soon after. Further medication review revealed that the patient had been recently started on rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy prophylaxis. Rifaximin has been occasionally reported to cause rhabdomyolysis in patients with hepatic insufficiency. The patient improved dramatically after cessation of the drug.
The patient’s strength continued to improve with therapy, and he was discharged on day 16 with a diagnosis of rifaximin-induced rhabdomyolysis.

Hospital Course:

The 16-year-old male patient presented to our clinical setting with a previous diagnosis of osteosarcoma in his left fibula. The patient underwent surgical excision of the tumor followed by the placement of a vascularized fibular bone graft and adjuvant chemotherapy. The patient went into remission, but subsequently presented with complaints of pain in his left leg and was diagnosed with reemergence of his primary pathology. Further assessment with imaging studies revealed areas of bony metastasis and multiple soft tissue nodules in both lungs, suggestive of a metastatic disease process.

The patient was started on a second-line chemotherapeutic regimen, which yielded significant clinical and radiological improvement. However, after one week, the patient presented with complaints of shortness of breath, accompanied by pleuritic chest pain and an intermittent, dry cough. The initial assessment revealed bilateral pneumothoraces and subsequent CT scans revealed numerous cystic lesions in both lung fields. The patient underwent bilateral chest tube insertion and chemical pleurodesis, which resulted in significant clinical and radiological improvement. Chemotherapy was resumed and the patient was discharged with a right pigtail insertion.

The patient was readmitted to our clinical setting after one month with a recurrent right-sided pneumothorax. The patient was managed conservatively via a chest drain, ultimately resulting in the resolution of the pneumothorax.

Attending Physician: Not disclosed

HOSPITAL COURSE:
The patient presented with a three-month history of numbness on the left side of his face, which gradually progressed and became painful in the month before the initial visit. He also complained about difficulty chewing on the left side. An examination revealed decreased sensation over the distribution of the left trigeminal nerve, associated with dyskinesia of the left masticatory muscles. Past medical history was significant for acute gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and depression, for which brotizolam, flunitrazepam, and paroxetine had been prescribed, respectively.

DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT:
Panoramic radiography identified slight restriction of movement of the temporomandibular joint on the left. MRI of the temporomandibular joint region and brain region revealed a tumor measuring 10 mm in diameter and a homogeneously high signal intensity on axial T1-weighted images compared with gray matter and low signal on axial T2-weighted images. The tumor was found in Meckel’s cave, appeared to be exerting pressure on his trigeminal nerve, and was homogeneously hyperdense compared with gray matter on unenhanced CT.

TREATMENT:
En bloc excision was performed, and immunohistochemistry was positive for melanocytic features of Melan A (MART1; melanoma antigen recognized by T cells-1), human melanoma black-45, vimentin, and S-100 protein and negative for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and glia fibrillary acidic protein. Cellular proliferation was assessed by staining for Ki-67. Following excision, the patient underwent adjuvant gamma knife radiosurgery with 24 Gy in two fractions to the tumor bed in the epidural space of the middle cranial fossa. No chemotherapy was administered.

IMPRESSION:
A definitive diagnosis of melanocytoma was made.

FOLLOW-UP:

Hospital Course:

The 75-year-old male patient was admitted with elevated serum hepatobiliary enzymes and a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, malignant otitis externa, and an operative history of emergent coronary artery bypass grafting. The results of preoperative laboratory testing showed elevated serum hepatobiliary enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and gamma glutamic transpeptidase. Imaging tests indicated the presence of a Bismuth type 4, T2N0M0 Stage II hilar cholangiocarcinoma with abrupt narrowing of the common hepatic duct and involvement of the right anterior and posterior bile duct bifurcations. Further investigation confirmed the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma.

Treatment:

The patient underwent left trisectionectomy, extrahepatic bile duct resection, and Roux-en-Y choledochojejunostomy 51 days after undergoing percutaneous balloon arterioplasty followed by bare-metal stent placement to prevent postoperative biliary complications due to the suspected benign stricture caused by atherosclerosis in the right posterior hepatic artery (RPHA).

Clinical Course:

The patient had bile leakage postoperatively, which was successfully controlled through percutaneous drainage. However, he was re-hospitalized with multiple pyogenic liver abscesses 4 months after hepatectomy that eventually led to liver failure. Despite intensive multimodal treatment for the pyogenic liver abscesses, the patient could not be saved.

Admitting Diagnosis: Generalized weakness, unintentional weight loss, cough, night sweats, and nonbloody, watery diarrhea.

Principal Diagnosis on Discharge: Right-sided hydropneumothorax.

Summary of Hospitalization:

The 40-year-old African American male was admitted to the hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, unintentional weight loss, cough, night sweats, and nonbloody, watery diarrhea. He reported prior history of incarceration and resided with his mother, for whom he was the primary caregiver. Initial vitals in the emergency department were significant for tachycardia. Physical examination at the time of admission revealed a thin, nontoxic appearing male.

Initial laboratory workup was significant for absolute CD4 count of 26 (3%). Chest X-ray in the emergency department revealed a cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level within the anterior medial right hemithorax and a loculated hydropneumothorax along the right lateral lung base. CT chest with contrast demonstrated two large, thick-walled cavitary lesions originating within the right lung parenchyma that appeared to communicate. His treatment was initiated with intravenous Ceftriaxone and Metronidazole. The patient's stool PCR isolated a Salmonella species. Diagnostic thoracentesis yielded purulent fluid with WBC 505,000, RBC 0, pH 6.0, protein 3.7, LDH 41,239, and glucose 12. Pleural fluid culture was positive for Salmonella species.

Due to presence of empyema, a right-sided chest tube was placed followed by instillation of tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) and DNase twice daily for three consecutive days. CT abdomen and pelvis with contrast demonstrated two rim-enhancing hypodense lesions within the central mesentery of the abdomen. Intra-abdominal drains were placed under CT guidance into the mesenteric abscesses, from which nontyphi Salmonella eventually grew late in hospital course.

On hospital day #4 the patient's right-sided chest tube was noted to have persistent air leak. CT chest without contrast confirmed persistent right-sided hydropneumothorax with centrilobular ground glass opacities with lung entrapment. On hospital day #10, the patient underwent right video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) with decortication. Pleural peel pathology revealed pleural fibrosis, focal chronic inflammation, and mild anthracosis. The patient completed an additional two weeks of antibiotic therapy with intravenous Ceftriaxone from the date of decortication.

On follow-up at four-months, CT chest demonstrated improved but persistent loculated right pneumothorax with resolution of the right lung cavitary lesions. At seven months, the CT demonstrated complete resolution of the right-sided pneumothorax.

Recommendations and Follow-up:

The patient is recommended to follow up with their primary care physician for ongoing management and monitoring of hypertension and substance abuse. Follow up imaging may be necessary to evaluate the persistence of loculated right pneumothorax. Further imaging may also be necessary to evaluate the rim-enhancing hypodense lesions within the central mesentery of the abdomen. The patient is advised to seek medical attention if any new or persistent symptoms arise.

Reason for Admission:
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute onset of painless hematochezia for 1 day. He had unprovoked deep venous thrombosis and portal-vein thrombosis on Apixaban, diagnosed 18 months prior to admission.

Hospital Course:
The patient was tachycardic and mildly hypotensive upon admission. There was no evidence of chronic liver disease on exam. The hemoglobin level was low and subsequently decreased, while the platelet count was within normal limits. Laboratory tests were conducted, and the results were normal, except for low albumin levels.

The patient's anticoagulation therapy was discontinued, and he was resuscitated with IV crystalloids. EGD and colonoscopy were performed, revealing small non-bleeding esophageal varices and a colonic varix with active bleeding, respectively. 

The patient was treated with IV octreotide at the satellite hospital and was later transferred to our tertiary institution for escalation of care. Liver-protocol computed tomography (CT) was performed for TIPS evaluation, revealing a steatotic liver and chronically thrombosed SMV with a patent portal vein. The patient was deemed not to be a candidate for either TIPS or BRTO in the setting of chronic SMV thrombosis.

The patient continued to have hematochezia, and a trans-hepatic portogram was performed, revealing an elevated absolute portal pressure. Digital subtraction images confirmed the site of the SMV occlusion at the confluence of two large SMV branches, in addition to retrograde flow through the large right CV. A catheter and stiff Glidewire were used to recanalize the occluded SMV using balloon angioplasty and self-expanding stents. Follow-up venography showed antegrade flow in the right SMV branch into the SMV stent with a marked reduction in filling of the right CV. 

Liver biopsy showed steatohepatitis with stage 2/4 fibrosis. Apixaban and low-dose aspirin were started. Two months after discharge, the patient had no recurrent bleeding and CT showed patent SMV stents. A plan for surveillance was determined using cross-sectional imaging every 6 months for 2 years.

Discharge Diagnosis:
Painless Hematochezia, Steatohepatitis with Stage 2/4 Fibrosis, Chronic SMV Thrombosis

Discharge Medications:
Apixaban, Low-Dose Aspirin

Patient: 44-year-old male with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted for induction chemotherapy (IC) on day 0 and experienced bone marrow suppression with fever and septic shock on day 10. Broad-spectrum antibacterial and antifungal prophylaxis were used empirically, with little success in controlling the patient's recurrent fever. The patient then experienced hemiplegia and hemiconvulsions on the right limb and was diagnosed with cerebral infarction in the right parietal lobe and small hypodense areas in the left and right parietal lobes. CT scans also showed multiple hyperdense lesions in the patient's lung on day 18. After a positive result for the test of (1,3)- β-D-glucan on day 22, treatment was changed to voriconazole (VRC) and imipenem, but the patient's fever persisted and the lesions in the brain and lung worsened.

On day 25, Rhizomucor miehei infection was shown by metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of peripheral blood (PB) with high relative abundance, and liposome-associated amphotericin B was administered as antifungal therapy. The patient's fever subsided, and his complete blood count (CBC) returned to normal on day 28. Infection with Rhizomucor miehei was also detected by mNGS findings in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on day 28 and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) on day 35. Antifungal therapy using liposome-associated amphotericin B was continued until day 55, and the patient's general condition improved, with partial recovery of the right limb function.

After discharge, the patient continued antifungal therapy with amphotericin B and posaconazole for 2 months and received a new chemotherapy for ALL. Follow-up imaging tests showed a significant reduction in the size of the lesions. The antifungal drug regimen was well-tolerated and achieved a remarkable effect. 

Important Findings:

The patient had a series of infections caused by Rhizomucor miehei, which were detected by mNGS findings. The antifungal therapy using liposome-associated amphotericin B was an effective treatment for the patient's condition. The recurrence of fever in febrile neutropenia patients after chemotherapy with cerebral symptoms may be highly indicative of infections in the brain.

Disposition:

The patient was discharged and requested to continue antifungal therapy at a local hospital due to family reasons.",,,0

This is a discharge summary for a 26-year-old woman who presented at 19 weeks and 4 days of gestation with a short cervix and placenta previa. The patient was asymptomatic and was managed with daily vaginal progesterone therapy as the diagnosis remained unclear. At 26 weeks of gestation, a repeat transvaginal ultrasound revealed that the cervix was 41 mm in length and the placenta position had changed. These findings supported spontaneous resolution of a retroverted incarcerated uterus. 

The patient had a normal course of pregnancy with no further complications. The patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 3/7 weeks and delivered a viable male infant weighing 3,035 grams with APGAR scores of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. 

The patient remains stable at the time of discharge with no further issues related to the previous diagnosis. The patient was advised to seek medical attention if any symptoms or complications arise in the future. The patient was provided with appropriate discharge instructions and education about any follow-up appointments and management.

Hospital Course Summary:
The patient presented with a short cervix and placenta previa at 19 weeks and 4 days of gestation. The diagnosis was unclear, and therefore expectant management with daily vaginal progesterone therapy was initiated. Weekly transvaginal ultrasound scans continued showing similar findings. A retrospective review of the earlier ultrasound images showed that the cervix was compressed against the anterior vaginal wall, and the cervix and the lower uterine segment were elongated and stretched along what was thought to be the anterior wall of the uterus. 

At 26 weeks of gestation, a repeat transvaginal ultrasound revealed that the cervix was 41 mm in length and the placenta position had changed. These findings supported spontaneous resolution of a retroverted incarcerated uterus. The patient had a normal course of pregnancy with no further complications after this point. The patient had a spontaneous vaginal delivery at 39 3/7 weeks and delivered a viable male infant weighing 3,035 grams with APGAR scores of 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes. 

The patient remains stable at the time of discharge with no further issues related to the previous diagnosis. The patient was advised to seek medical attention if any symptoms or complications arise in the future. The patient was provided with appropriate discharge instructions and education about any follow-up appointments and management.

This is a summary of the hospital course of a 67-year-old female who was referred for right distal tibial non-union with progressive valgus deformity after a fragility fracture.

History of Presenting Illness:
The patient initially received locked antegrade intra-medullary nailing, which was unsuccessful. An expandable retrograde nail was then inserted, followed by an Ilizarov frame two months later. Three months after that, the non-union had united and the frame was removed. The nail was left in place for an additional six months to allow further consolidation of the non-union. 

Past Medical History:
The patient has neither reported nor been diagnosed with any past medical history.

Hospital Course:
The first attempt to remove the expandable nail was unsuccessful, as the nail fractured at the junction between the valve and the fins. Subsequent attempts were made later and were successful, with the nail being successfully pushed out using an antegrade nail. The patient recovered well after the procedure.

Medical History:
The patient presented with shortness of breath and was diagnosed with left-sided pneumothorax upon admission. The patient had no significant medical history prior to admission.

Hospital Course:
Upon admission, the patient received a 12 French trocar tube to allow their lungs to expand slowly. However, on the day after chest tube insertion, the patient experienced air leakage through the chest tube. An x-ray revealed that the lungs had not expanded much and thus, the partial clamped rubber tube was de-clamped. An hour after de-clamping, the patient suddenly complained of severe respiratory distress, cough with foamy sputum, and vomiting. The chest tube was immediately clamped to stop drainage and the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit for mechanical ventilation. After supportive care including mechanical ventilation and intubation, the patient's condition improved and they were transferred to a general ward. A chest tube was later inserted due to the recurrence of pneumothorax and the patient underwent video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection. Following the surgery, the patient recovered without any complications and was discharged.

Assessment and Plan:
The patient showed evidence of left-sided pneumothorax upon admission. The patient underwent a chest tube insertion and VATS surgery, which resulted in recovery without any complications.

1646,"Discharge summary for Mr. X, an edentulous 53-year-old male with history of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the maxilla:

Summary:
Mr. X was referred to the Prosthodontics Department of Tehran University of Medical Sciences for implant-supported maxillary and mandibular prostheses. The patient had undergone surgical resection and radiotherapy of an ACC in the right side of the maxillary arch one and a half years ago. Three dental implants were inserted in the maxilla and mandible without any bone augmentation. After the removal of the most distal implant of the upper arch due to the lack of osseointegration, another implant was placed. The presence of acceptable osseointegration was confirmed clinically by torque test and x-ray radiography. Primary and final impressions were made, and individual stud attachments were chosen. The treatment was continued by considering the possible failure of the suspicious implant. 15° angled abutments were selected to compensate for the minimal implant divergence and to create a definite path of insertion for the obturator that would accommodate both attachments and the extension of the prosthesis into the defect (bulb), while straight attachments were used for the mandibular overdenture. Before processing the prostheses, another try-in session was managed. At the delivery visit, the abutments were secured in the mouth with 30-newton centimeter (N/cm) torque and the prostheses were checked and adjusted. The patient received oral hygiene instructions and a recommendation to wear the obturator at night for managing mucosal and salivary secretions. Regular six-month follow-ups for two years showed acceptable conditions of the implants and the prostheses. Long-term observations will be used to ensure the patient’s oral health and the competence of the prostheses.

Hospital Course:
-Referral to Prosthodontics Department for implant-supported maxillary and mandibular prostheses
-Insertion of three dental implants in the maxilla and mandible without any bone augmentation
-Removal of the most distal implant of the upper arch due to the lack of osseointegration
-Placement of another implant after confirmation of acceptable osseointegration
-Selection of individual stud attachments and 15° angled abutments to compensate for minimal implant divergence and create a definite path of insertion for the obturator

Reason for Admission:
The patient reported a 1-month history of spontaneous clear left side nipple discharge with a recent appearance of a homolateral painless breast swelling.

History and Physical Examination:
The patient had a past medical history pertinent for obesity class I and bilateral hypoacusia for otosclerosis. On physical examination, he was an overweight Caucasian male with symmetrical breasts. On palpation, there was a bilateral pseudogynaecomastia with a smooth, ill-defined left breast thickening, especially at the union of the outer quadrants. With applied pressure, a minimal clear stream of discharge fluid was elicited from the left nipple and was felt to be localized to a single duct.

Medical Condition:

Discharge Diagnosis: PE and massive DVT

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 70-year-old man with a medical history of bronchial asthma, eosinophilic sinusitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, cerebral infarction, and steroid-induced diabetes mellitus, was referred to our hospital due to warmness, pain, and swelling in his left leg and a feeling of gait disturbance that occurred 2 days before his admission. Physical examination revealed swelling and tenderness in his left leg with the left thigh circumference greater than the right. Diagnostic testing, including laboratory findings, venous ultrasonography, and contrast-enhanced CT scans, indicated extensive thrombosis in the left iliofemoral vein, left popliteal vein, and left posterior tibial vein. Additionally, spread of the thrombus in the IVC and several thrombi in the left upper lobe branch and the bilateral lower lobe branch were detected, confirming the diagnosis of PE and massive DVT. 

Treatment for DVT with fondaparinux was initiated on the day of admission, and a Günther Tulip Filter was deployed in the suprarenal IVC via the right internal jugular vein to prevent a fatal PE. However, after 7 days of treatment with fondaparinux, the DVT did not improve. Therefore, CDT was initiated on the eighth day of hospitalization. A 50 cm-long Fountain infusion catheter was passed through the entire extent of the thrombus via the left popliteal vein, and urokinase was repeatedly splashed out through the catheter, once a day for 6 days. In addition, continuous intravenous administration of unfractionated heparin was started to keep the activated partial thromboplastin time 1.5- to 2.0-fold longer than the control value. After 6 days of CDT treatment, a significant improvement in the patient's left leg pain and swelling was observed with reduction in left thigh circumference. However, residual thrombi were detected from the IVC to the left posterior tibial vein, necessitating a switch in the thrombolytic treatment for DVT from CDT to direct oral anticoagulant (edoxaban; 60 mg/day).

The patient was discharged on the 17th day of hospitalization without any bleeding or infection. Approximately 2 months after the start of oral medical treatment, the patient showed improvement in DVT treatment with few thrombi other than in part of the left iliac vein, and D-dimer levels decreased to 0.5 μg/mL. The thrombolytic therapy with edoxaban has been continued in this patient.

Admitting Diagnosis: Ovarian Cancer stage IVB with malignant transformation of Malignant Teratoma (MCT)

Hospital Course Summary:

The patient presented with abdominal distention that had worsened over the previous year. Pelvic examination and imaging studies indicated the presence of a large cystic mass with a solid component in both hypochondrium. Further analysis of serum tumor markers showed elevated levels of CA19-9 and CA125. Imaging studies also revealed the presence of a 3 cm mass in the liver with FDG uptake, suggesting metastasis. A percutaneous liver biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic cells in normal hepatocytes and a clinical diagnosis of ovarian cancer stage IVB with malignant transformation of the MCT was made.

The patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and partial omentectomy. Pathological findings revealed the presence of an MCT and clear cell carcinoma with malignant transformation. Although the left fallopian tube had a lymphovascular space of invasion with calcifying carcinoma cells, the uterus and omentum showed no signs of malignancy.

The patient received three courses of chemotherapy consisting of paclitaxel and carboplatin. CT scanning after treatment revealed a vanished hepatic metastasis and emerging swelling of the para-aortic lymph node. Despite receiving three courses of doxorubicin, chemotherapy was not effective due to the progressive disease. The patient began receiving the best possible supportive care. The patient passed away after 17 months from the operation.

During the hospital stay, the patient's vital signs, laboratory values, and physical examinations were monitored and managed appropriately. The patient was discharged after appropriate counseling and provision of discharge summaries to the outpatient healthcare providers.

She had undergone an open myomectomy 1 year prior, following which she was reviewed in the gynecological outpatient clinic for ongoing symptoms. A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a live intramural ectopic pregnancy, with a thin 3-mm layer of myometrium surrounding it. An MRI was performed to evaluate her condition further, which confirmed a gestational sac in the right uterine cornua. Placental invasion was also identified, thought to be over the previous myomectomy site. The management options considered included medical management, uterine wedge resection, or hysterectomy, with the goal of preserving the patient's fertility. However, surgical intervention was deemed the safest approach, and a midline laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, and bilateral salpingectomy were performed. The patient's blood loss was minimal, and her postoperative recovery was uneventful. She was discharged 3 days later.

Key Findings:

- The patient presented with vaginal discharge and pain in the right iliac fossa, accompanied by a positive β-HCG indicating a 12-week pregnancy.
- A previous open myomectomy had been performed, following which the patient had ongoing symptoms.
- A transvaginal ultrasound revealed a live intramural ectopic pregnancy with a thin layer of myometrium surrounding it.
- An MRI identified a gestational sac containing a mobile fetus within the myometrium of the right uterine cornua with marked thinning of the overlying myometrium to 3 mm.

Hospital Course:
- Patient was admitted with fever and burning micturition
- Laboratory investigation showed an increased white blood cell count and an elevated creatinine level of 3.5 mg dl–1
- Ultrasound imaging revealed bilateral hydroureteronephrosis
- MRI was performed to identify the cause of the hydronephrosis, which showed filling defects in the calyces of both kidneys
- MRI also revealed a thin rim of parenchymal diffusion restriction at the calyx and tip of the medullary pyramids in both kidneys, suggesting early right-sided pyelonephritis with a diagnosis of bilateral papillary necrosis
- Urine culture showed the growth of Escherichia coli, which was treated with antibiotics
- Bilateral ureteric stenting was carried out, resulting in the improvement of patient symptoms
- Routine urine examination and culture returned to normal
- In patients with elevated creatinine levels, intravenous urography or contrast-enhanced CT or MR urography may not be possible, therefore, MRI is preferred as it provides valuable information and does not expose the patient to radiation

Patient: 50-year-old male

Medical History: T6 AIS A SCI from a gunshot wound, chronic pain, left hip and knee heterotophic ossification, chronic right hip dislocation

Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency room with a right shoulder mass in September 2014, which was causing acute pain, weakness and paresthesias in the right arm. He was admitted to the general medicine service for pain management and underwent an evaluation for his right shoulder mass. Physiatry was consulted due to his functional deterioration that precluded him from returning to his previous independent living arrangement. The MRI revealed a 6.9 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass involving the right deltoid and pectoralis major muscles, and the core biopsy showed a high grade spindle cell sarcoma.

Treatment Approach:
The oncology department recommended neo-adjuvant radiation therapy followed by gross total resection with wide margins. Physiatry conducted a pre-operative evaluation to focus on functional prognostication. The patient's personal values combined with physiatric assessment determined the pre-surgical planning. A decision was made to take a narrower surgical margin around key muscle group (pectoralis major and deltoids) in order to help maintain the man's manual wheelchair mobility and his ability to independently transfer himself. In November 2014, he completed neo-adjuvant radiation therapy and underwent radical excision of his right shoulder mass with flap closure in December 2014.

Rehabilitation:
The patient began intensive inpatient rehabilitation after he was allowed to weight bear through his arm about 8 weeks later. Initially he required total assistance for most Activities of Daily Living (ADL), including transfers, manual wheelchair propulsion, dressing and toileting. Despite the extensive surgery and radiation treatments, the gentleman was able to return to a functional level, approaching his pre-morbid status (modified independence).

Discharge Plan:
The patient was in a stable condition and was successfully discharged home to live alone in his accessible apartment complex. 

Follow-up Care:
The patient requires regular follow-up care with the oncology and physiatry departments. He needs to attend scheduled appointments for close monitoring of his condition and to ensure that his medication is adjusted accordingly if needed. He should be encouraged to follow a proper diet and exercise routine and attend physical therapy as recommended.",,,0

Patient Name: Unavailable
Date of Admission: Unavailable
Date of Discharge: Unavailable

Hospital Course:
The patient, a 24-year-old Hispanic male, presented to our facility with recurrent bilateral pleural effusion and thickening lasting for two years. The patient had a positive QuantiFERON-TB test but negative sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture. The patient was discharged, but after being lost to follow-up, he returned with new-onset headaches and seizures. Clinical tests revealed numerous ring-enhancing brain lesions with vasogenic edema, indicating the possibility of infectious etiology. Consequently, a lumbar puncture was performed, revealing an opening pressure of 370 mm H2O, a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count of 8 × 103/µL, and CSF glucose and protein were 50 mg/dL and 89 mm/dL, respectively, with a 55% lymphocyte predominance.

Diagnosis:
The differential diagnosis included neurocysticercosis, tuberculomas, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma, and metastatic brain cancer. Due to a high index of suspicion for TB, the patient was empirically placed on 4 anti-TB medications and a steroid. Pleural biopsy showed caseating granulomata pleural with negative AFB stain. The patient's biopsy grew M. tuberculosis complex after 6 weeks in the laboratory and a report by the Public Health Services Department showed pansensitivity without any resistance.

Treatment:
The patient was administered isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol, pyridoxine, and dexamethasone for a total of 2 months with maintenance therapy consisting of isoniazid and rifampin for an additional 9 months. Dexamethasone was administered and tapered over a total of 8 weeks. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved with this drug regimen.

Follow-up:
The patient was discharged home with a release of airborne isolation after 3 negative sputum AFBs. No further appointments or follow-up testing was scheduled at our facility. 

Impression:
The patient was diagnosed with M. tuberculosis complex and treated appropriately with standard anti-TB medications. The patient's symptoms rapidly improved with the drug regime, and repeat brain imaging a few weeks after initiation of medications revealed that some of the tuberculomas had already resolved. There were no complications from the treatment, and the patient was discharged in stable health.",,,0
1868,"Discharge Summary:

Patient was a 12-year-old female who presented to the emergency department with altered mental status and blood glucose levels more than 49 mg/dL. After 24-h monitoring, the patient continued to experience hypoglycemic episodes. Further investigation led to the discovery of a 2.0 × 1.5 × 1.9 cm enhancing mass expanding the sella turcica which was removed through laparoscopic enucleation, confirming low-grade insulinoma. The patient was successful in resolving the hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and genetic testing confirmed a novel mutation with no evidence of metastatic disease. Follow-up MRI after 10 months of treatment with cabergoline for the prolactinoma demonstrated near-normalization of pituitary size. Additionally, adrenal function recovered as demonstrated by morning cortisol of 19.1 mcg/dL (527 nmol/L) 4 months after presentation and puberty progressed at a slowed rate to Tanner B2PH2. Height initially declined but was back to normal with a growth velocity of 11 cm/year. Patient was discharged with a complete resolution of symptoms.",,,0

Patient Name: [redacted]
Admission Date: [redacted]
Discharge Date: [redacted]

Hospital Course:

The patient was admitted to the hospital with complaints of right upper abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and mild to moderate pain radiating to the back. The patient also reported a weight loss of 10 kg over the last two months. Upon evaluation, a palpable, poorly defined, mildly to moderately tender tumor-like firmness was detected in the right upper quadrant. The laboratory evaluations showed elevated white blood cell count, bilirubin, and cancer marker CA 19-9 was within normal range. Imaging techniques, including computed tomography, revealed a large mass replacing the gallbladder body and fundus with an extensive involvement of the adjacent liver segments, the duodenum, the head of the pancreas, and the hepatic flexure of the colon. Advanced stage IIIb-IVa CG was the main differential diagnosis. Surgical exploration revealed a mass occupying the entire subhepatic space adherent to other structures, and an extensive surgical resection of the mass was performed with adjacent liver segments and loco-regional lymph nodes. The surgical pathology revealed an XG tumor with multiple areas of crowding of foamy macrophages and xanthoma cells, alongside foreign body granulomas consisting of cholesterol and tiny bile lakes. Mild to moderate reactive inflammatory changes of the adjacent hepatic tissue were noted with lymphocytic infiltration of portal tracts and fatty degeneration. The enlarged periportal lymph nodes showed a nonspecific inflammatory reaction.

Discharge Condition:

The patient was discharged home on day seven post-operation in good condition.

Follow-up:

The patient is advised to follow-up for regular check-ups to monitor with their primary care physician.

Primary Diagnosis:  Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XG)

Secondary Diagnosis: None

Procedures:

- Extensive surgical resection including adjacent liver segments and loco-regional lymph nodes for proper staging and prognosis.

Summary:

A 67-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with complaints of right upper abdominal tenderness, nausea, vomiting, and mild to moderate pain radiating to the back. Advanced stage IIIb-IVa CG was the main differential diagnosis, and surgical exploration confirmed a mass occupying the subhepatic space.

Patient Name: [REDACTED]
Age: 74 years
Gender: Male
Admission Date: July 2019
Discharge Date: September 2021

History of Present Illness:
The patient presented with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in May 2019. Before starting the treatment, HBV serology revealed the presence of HBeAg and HBV DNA in serum. He was diagnosed with HBVr and started entecavir (ETV) treatment in July 2019. The therapy reduced viremia to a certain extent, but the decrease plateaued after 6 months. In January 2021, the patient switched to tenofovir alafenamide (TAF), which resulted in a rapid decline of HBV DNA levels.

Past Medical History:
The patient received a kidney transplant for nephroangiosclerosis in August 2013, and he was included in the follow-up program as per protocol. The serologic screening for HBV pre-transplant showed that he was HBsAg-negative and anti-HBs-positive. He was positive for the HBeAg and antibodies to the HBeAg and to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc). After the transplant, the patient received immunosuppressive induction as prescribed. The kidney donor was negative for HBV. The indices of hepatic cytolysis were normal throughout the follow-up program. The patient was diagnosed with HBVr in May 2019.

Assessment and Plan:
The case report revealed that the patient, despite having a high titer of HBV DNA in serum, was HBsAg-negative. The patient was diagnosed with HBVr and started ETV treatment, which initially reduced viremia but plateaued after 6 months. The patient switched to TAF treatment, which resulted in a rapid decline of HBV DNA levels. The patient had four mutations within the a-determinant and five additional mutations within the MHR. The patient was infected with HBV genotype D.

Follow-Up:
The patient underwent a close follow-up for the first 6 months of ETV treatment, followed by monthly scheduling thereafter. The patient started TAF treatment in January 2021, which resulted in a rapid decline of HBV DNA levels. The patient experienced a single episode of ALT elevation in the 2nd month of TAF treatment in the course of an infection of the residual left limb.

Disposition:
The patient was discharged from the Infectious Disease Section of the Verona University Hospital in September 2021. The patient died due to coronary heart disease.

In summary, the patient presented with HBVr and was treated with ETV followed by TAF treatment. The patient had multiple mutations within the a-determinant and MHR, and was infected with HBV genotype D. Follow-up included monitoring of viral load and liver function. The patient ultimately died due to a coronary heart disease.",,,0
