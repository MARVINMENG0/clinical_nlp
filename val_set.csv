Admitting Diagnosis: Ovarian cyst

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted with a three-day history of increasing abdominal bloating, vomiting, and fevers. On admission, the patient had a temperature of 39.9°C, a heart rate of 127, and a respiratory rate of 35. Initial investigations showed mildly deranged liver enzymes, an elevated CRP, and slightly elevated CA-125 and CA-19.9. CT scan showed a 22 × 13 cm multiseptated cystic lesion almost certainly of ovarian aetiology, as well as omental fat hazing, raising the possibility of an acute omental infarction. The patient was admitted for observation and intravenous antibiotics. Her fever resolved, and she was discharged home with a plan to follow-up in outpatient clinic for elective ovarian cystectomy.

Ten days later, the patient re-presented to the hospital with severe abdominal pain and ongoing fevers. Repeat laboratory results showed worsening liver enzymes and a further rise of CRP. A repeat CT scan showed the large ovarian cyst had likely ruptured with new generalized ascites and peritoneal enhancement, concerning for disseminated disease.

Treatment:
The patient underwent emergency laparotomy with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, infracolic omentectomy, and appendectomy. The cyst had a small leak, and 3.5 L of fluid was drained from the cyst and sent for histology. A further 200 ml of ascitic fluid was collected. Inflammatory changes on the surface of the pelvis, and multiple inflammatory deposits overlying small bowel mesentery were noted. Histology of the cyst showed a benign mucinous cystadenoma. The uterus, ovarian cyst, omentum, and appendix contained florid granulomatous inflammation and caseous necrosis. Peritoneal fluid cultured Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A chest CT confirmed lymph node calcification consistent with previous tuberculosis, with no evidence of active infection.

Disposition:
The patient's postoperative recovery was uneventful, and she was commenced on isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide under guidance of the Infectious Disease team. The patient remained well at a recent 3-month follow-up.",0.0,0.0,0
2260,"Medical History:
The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of chemotherapy for coat cell lymphoma in 2011, splenectomy in 2013 and autologous bone marrow transplantation in 2014.

Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) due to fever and malaise. Upon admission, she was somnolent with rales over both lungs and tachycardia without heart murmurs. She was suspected of having sepsis with septic shock and pneumonia. Standard electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus tachycardia of 125/min.

Treatment and Diagnostic Procedures:
The patient's shock was managed initially by rapid infusion of crystalloids followed by noradrenalin infusion up-titrated to 66μg/min and other medications to reach normotension. Imipenem 500 mg/6 h IV was administered after collecting hemocultures, urinoculture and aspirates. Continuous ECG monitoring, pulse oximetry, non-invasive blood pressure measurements were performed along with central venous, arterial and urine catheters for hemodynamic and fluid management.

Results:
Positive pneumococcal urine antigen confirmed streptococcal pneumonia, and other microbiological cultures remained negative. The patient needed 40% oxygen by mask for satisfactory blood gases and did not need either non-invasive or invasive ventilation during the entire ICU stay. Hemodynamic instability led to the decision to start continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVH) combined with hemoadsoption treatment by CytoSorb® membrane for the next 24 h, which improved hemodynamic situation. The patient received CVVH intermittently for another 21 days.

Discharge Summary:
The patient recovered from septic shock with improvement in hemodynamics and inflammatory response after receiving comprehensive treatment and diagnostic procedures. The goal of the treatment was to improve renal function, and she was discharged from the medical ICU after 10 days and from the hospital after 76 days.",1.0,0.0,0

The patient, a 56-year-old male with no known comorbidities, was admitted to the emergency department with fever, headache, and sporadic vomiting for the past 2 days. On admission, the patient exhibited fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and poor sensorium. CT scan showed cystic gliosis changes in the left frontal lobe, which was consistent with the surgical history the patient had undergone for a CSF leak 23 years ago. CSF analysis revealed pleocytosis and hypoglycorrachia, suggesting acute pyogenic meningitis. The patient was started on empiric antibiotics and showed improvement. However, he experienced a drop in sensorium, and MRI of the brain with contrast showed post-contrast enhancement of leptomeninges and ventricular walls, along with exudates in the ventricles, indicating ventriculitis. CT cisternogram was performed to check for residual CSF leak, which revealed a porencephalic cyst communicating with the left frontal horn. The patient responded well to intravenous antibiotics and was discharged on day 10 with instructions to continue antibiotics for 6 weeks in view of ventriculitis.

Diagnosis:

Acute pyogenic meningitis with subsequent ventriculitis in the setting of a cystic gliosis change in the left frontal lobe communicating with the frontal horn.

Patient Name: [Redacted]
Gender: Female
Age: 9 Years old
Admission Date: January 2016
Discharge Date: N/A

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 9-year-old female with no medical history, presented with low back and left lower limb pain in January 2016. She was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left tibia with a solitary metastasis in her L3 vertebrae in February 2016. She subsequently underwent a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation from L1 to L5 with decompression laminectomy at L2-3, and L3-4 through a posterior and left thoracoabdominal approach in March 2016. The patient was found to have an abnormal bone scan with a lesion at the L3 level 3 months after completing chemotherapy in November 2016. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) of right paraspinal psoas tissue, the patient was confirmed to have recurrent osteoblastic osteosarcoma in December 2016.

Physical Examination:

On physical examination, the patient was able to ambulate with use of a below knee prosthesis and demonstrated no neurological deficits.

Treatment:

The patient was started on second line drugs, including two cycles of ifosfamide/etoposide. Previous implants were well in place. Imaging was performed with radiographs, CT scan, bone scan, PET scan, and MRI scan with contrast enhancement to confirm only a single metastatic site. The option of nonoperative palliative care was offered to the patient and her family, but they elected to proceed with en bloc resection to maximize her chances of survival, in spite of high surgical risk and an overall poor prognosis. They were informed preoperatively that a complete resection would require sacrificing her nerve roots at L2, L3 and L4. A palliative decompression was not offered for the revision procedure as a treatment option as the patient was not complaining of pain or neurological symptoms, and it would not have improved her life expectancy. 

Conclusion:

In summary, the patient is a 9-year-old female with no previous medical history who was diagnosed with osteosarcoma of the left tibia with a solitary metastasis in her L3 vertebrae. Despite undergoing a left below knee amputation and L3 corpectomy with posterior spinal fusion and instrumentation, the patient was confirmed to have a recurrence of osteoblastic osteosarcoma. The patient was started on second line drugs and subsequently had en bloc resection of L2, L3, and L4. The decision was made with the family to proceed with this risky surgery in order to maximize the patient's chances of survival, despite an overall poor prognosis.",1.0,0.0,0

This 70-year-old male patient was admitted to the hospital presenting with increased appetite, palpitations, weight loss, and heat intolerance. Physical examination revealed the presence of a 4 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. The patient had a known history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and coronary artery disease.

Diagnostic Findings:

The patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level was suppressed 0.29 uIU/mL, while free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) were elevated. A radioiodine uptake scan detected an abnormal focus of hot uptake in the left lobe, which was suggestive of a hyperfunctioning toxic thyroid nodule. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed, and the cytology report indicated thyroid carcinoma. 

Treatment:

The patient underwent total thyroidectomy, and the pathological report confirmed FVPTC findings. The lesion was limited to the solitary tumor, measuring a diameter of 3.5 cm. Ablative radioiodine therapy was not recommended due to the small size of the tumor. Post-surgery, the patient received levothyroxine medication to prevent hypothyroidism and to stop TSH stimulation. 

Follow-Up:

Serum TSH and serum thyroglobulin were regularly monitored. On follow-up visit, radioactive iodine whole-body scan showed no distant metastasis. 

Summary:

This 70-year-old male patient presented classic symptoms of hyperthyroidism which were investigated by FNA revealing FVPTC arising within a toxic nodule.

Principal Diagnosis: MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1)

Hospital Course:

The patient, a 75-year-old Caucasian man, was admitted for bicytopenia in May 2013. His initial blood cell count showed hemoglobin 8 g/dl, platelets 87 × 109/l, and leukocytes 6.1 × 109/L. He had a medical history of T2D treated with biphasic insulin aspart and triple-bypass surgery for coronary disease in 2010. No family history of hematological malignancies was noted. He was hospitalized in an intensive care unit for grade IV anemia and then transferred to the hematology department after blood transfusions. Bone marrow aspiration showed multilineage dysplasia with 8% of blasts, consistent with a diagnosis of MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1).

The patient was initially treated with darbepoetin 300 μg per week, without response. A second bone marrow aspiration two months later showed 29% of blasts, consistent with the diagnosis of AML progression. He consented to participate in a phase I–II clinical research study assessing the combination of 5-azacitidine with idarubicin in July 2013. He showed a partial response with 8% of bone marrow blasts after six cycles, and transfusion independence.

However, the patient reported higher blood glucose levels 2–3 days after the start of each 5-azacitidine cycle, requiring an increased dose of self-administered insulin. Further monitoring confirmed higher blood glucose levels from days 4 to 12 of each 5-azacitidine cycle. No change in diet or in physical activities was noted. Our patient experienced such dysregulation during all the additional 15 cycles until a fatal progression of AML.

Impression:

The patient was admitted with bicytopenia and diagnosed with MDS with excess blasts: refractory anemia with excess blasts-1 (RAEB-1). After no response to initial treatment, he participated in a clinical research study and experienced a partial response. However, he had blood glucose dysregulation during the treatment cycles.
